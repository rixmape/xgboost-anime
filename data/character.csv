Nanami is highly independent and strongly entrepreneurial, going so far as to take payment from the high school's Broadcast Club to grill her brother over the fraudulent election results on campus television. When she's sent to El-Hazard, she's initially alone and is forced to take on a waitressing job to earn enough money to travel, but she eventually meets up with Makoto and Fujisawa at the Fountain of Arliman, where she is able to start a small business selling boxed lunches to the visiting priestesses. Nanami has feelings for Makoto, but she's never really had the opportunity to talk about a relationship with him. 

Nanami's power gained upon entering El-Hazard is to see through the illusions of the Phantom Tribe, making her a viable defense against the greatest threat in the first OVA series. 

Nanami in The Wanderers 

The Phantom Tribe does not exist in the alternate timeline, and so instead Nanami has the same power to communicate with the Bugrom as her brother. Her past relationship with Makoto is also explored a bit more in detail, and she becomes good friends with Princess Rune Venus. As well, in the last episode of the TV series, Alielle describes Nanami and herself as ""special friends"", lending their relationship a certain homoerotic subtext, though this seems to be more along the lines of a big sister relationship.

Holding true to the classic anime redhead stereotype, this tanned priestess' temper is as fiery as her hair, matching her control over the element of fire. Makoto, Fujisawa and Alielle first meet her when she rescues them from a Bugrom attack on Mt. Muldoon, but she runs off with Afura without hearing them out about their mission. When she first learns Makoto's true identity, she accuses him of being a pervert and tries to roast him, but after he saves her life when Ifurita awakens, she begins to have feelings for him. She also has a friendly rivalry with the wind priestess Afura Mann.

Shayla-Shayla in The Wanderers

Rather than be centralized in one location, the three priestesses each run a separate temple. Fittingly enough, Shayla's fire temple is located in a volcano. She is just as temper-driven as her OVA persona, but with the addition of being a heavy gambler. When Makoto and Fujisawa first meet her, she had lost her clothes and the entire temple to Jinnai in a rigged game.

Qawool is also very afraid of insects, which causes her to destroy whatever is around her. Like Alielle, Qawool addresses Makoto Mizuhara as master, because he saved her life. She is also in love with him.

As a minor note, when The Alternative World was released in North America through Pioneer Animation (or Geneon, as it is now called), her name was written as ""Qawool"" and ""Qawoor"" on the packaging (the spelling used depended on the volume.) Ostensibly, this was done to make her name sound more native to El-Hazard, since ""Qawool"" can be hard for English speakers to distinguish from ""Kaoru,"" a very common name in Japan. It may also be an attempt to represent the ""ku-sub-a"" phoneme that begins her name.

Qawool was introduced in The Alternative World and does not appear in The Wanderers.

With the exception of a few features, she has the external appearance of a beautiful woman and is the only fully humanoid member of the tribe, though this may possibly be an illusion, as with the case of the ruler of the Insects in the Alternate World of Creteria. When Katsuhiko arrives in El-Hazard and is brought before her by some of her soldiers, she becomes convinced that he is actually a messenger sent by God destined to lead the Bugrom to victory over their enemies in the Alliance. Impressed by Katsuhiko's ability to mobilize the troops and conquer nations with ease, she also becomes romantically interested in him. When the Bugrom homeland is annihilated by the Eye of God, she manages to avoid the attack with Jinnai's personal squad by traveling to deliver supplies to Katsuhiko on the frontline.

At the start of the Alternate World series, she is urged by Jinnai to produce eggs for the new colony they are constructing, due to the Bugrom having been decimated by the Eye of God- even though more survivors have found their way to the new colony, their numbers are still insufficient. However, much to Jinnai's horror, she needs to have a mate in order to give birth to a new generation, and Jinnai is the only male available at the time (at least, that is what she claims). Jinnai's attempt to escape her is why he and his squad are transported to Cretari. Once they return, however, Jinnai is dragged into Diva's amorous embrace.

Diva in The Wanderers

Diva is very much a background character in the OVA, and she doesn't have much more to do in The Wanderers, either. However, the relationship between her, Jinnai and the bubble-headed Ifurita does take on a rather comedic family dynamic. Also, The Wanderers is the only El-Hazard series in which Diva encounters a human character without a special power to understand the Bugrom language.

Impressed by Katsuhiko's ability to mobilize the troops and conquer nations with ease, she also becomes romantically interested in him. When the Bugrom homeland is annihilated by the Eye of God, she manages to avoid the attack with Jinnai's personal squad by traveling to deliver supplies to Katsuhiko on the frontline.

At the start of the Alternate World series, she is urged by Jinnai to produce eggs for the new colony they are constructing, due to the Bugrom having been decimated by the Eye of God- even though more survivors have found their way to the new colony, their numbers are still insufficient. However, much to Jinnai's horror, she needs to have a mate in order to give birth to a new generation, and Jinnai is the only male available at the time (at least, that is what she claims). Jinnai's attempt to escape her is why he and his squad are transported to Cretari. Once they return, however, Jinnai is dragged into Diva's amorous embrace.

Diva in The Wanderers

Diva is very much a background character in the OVA, and she doesn't have much more to do in The Wanderers, either. However, the relationship between her, Jinnai and the bubble-headed Ifurita does take on a rather comedic family dynamic. Also, The Wanderers is the only El-Hazard series in which Diva encounters a human character without a special power to understand the Bugrom language.

Of the three priestesses, her personality is delved into the least, and she comes off being rather wooden and serious most of the time, although she does make the occasional crack at Shayla's expense. Even though she is about the same age as Shayla, she's much more calm and composed. Still, she's not above shirking her duties on occasion, as she and Shayla are both late for the start of the rituals at Arliman after shopping at a bazaar, and like Shayla, she fails to listen to Makoto's pleas when they first meet.

Afura in The Wanderers

Afura remains a studious, intelligent priestess in the television series. However, her background with Shayla-Shayla is plumbed into much more detail, and her personality is given slightly more definition. Not much else changes, though. Her temple is located on a windy mountain peak and contains an extensive library of texts.

Masamichi Fujisawa is a history teacher at Shinonome High. Not known for his hygiene or concern for fashion, Fujisawa is a lanky man with a mop of scraggly dark hair atop his head and his face is peppered with the occasional stubble. Clothing wise, he tends to opt for comfort over style and thus is more likely to be seen wearing a warm-up suit over an Armani and sandals instead of Bruno Magli. 

However, while his dedication to his appearance may come into question, his devotion to his students and teaching cannot. He is definitely filled with school spirit and his dedication to his students can only be rivaled by his love for three things: 1. Smoking 2. Drinking 3. Mountain Climbing.

When Makoto catches wind of this and plans are made for him to testify against Jinnai (who is called ""Jinnai"" by everyone except his sister), the egocentric, power-hungry and soon-to-be-impeached Student Body President attempts to thwart the process by attacking Makoto, intending to keep him tied up until a technicality in the bylaws prevents him from being thrown out of office. Before he can execute his plan, however, he's sent to El-Hazard, and once there encounters the Bugrom, a race of human-sized insectoid beings ruled by Queen Diva.

Jinnai's power granted to him by the trip is the ability to communicate with the Bugrom, allowing him to become their military commander under their belief that he is the messenger from God sent to lead the Bugrom to victory. A skilled tactician, he is able to reorganize the Bugrom forces into an effective army and comes close to conquering El-Hazard.

Although Jinnai is a power-hungry egomaniac, he's not without some level of humanity. When Galus attempts to stop Makoto and the others from halting the Eye of God's apocalyptic malfunction, he takes the leader of the Phantom Tribe by surprise with the help of a Bugrom soldier. Although Jinnai effectively comes to Makoto and Nanami's rescue, he does so more for the fact that a ""true ruler doesn't destroy the land he wishes to conquer."" Jinnai has a very distinctive laugh.

Jinni suffers from an obsession with Makoto that borders of the psychotic. Over the course of both series, he consistently blames Makoto for essentially every single failure and disappointment he experiences. His sense of his own history is a montage of misfortune, the chief architect of which is Makoto. Though generally megalomaniacal, one of his primary motivations in gaining power is to subsequently gain the ability to best, or, even kill him.

Jinnai in The Wanderers

Jinnai does not change much in the transition from OVA to TV series, either, but he seems to treat Ifurita with more care. Although he's threatened with impeachment from his position as Student Body President at the beginning of the series and Makoto plays no direct role in the trial, he is paranoid that Makoto will replace him as president once he is kicked out of office.

Additionally, Jinnai reveals a softer side at the end of the series, showing a certain fatherly affection towards Ifurita after she stops the Eye of God from plowing into Roshtaria.   ~From Wikipedia",Main,"Okiayu, Ryoutarou, Klein, Robert Martin, Artaux, Cyrille, Serrano, José Javier, Kaufmann, Sascha","Japanese, English, French, Spanish, German","https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/80436.jpg?s=db6e64580a47c97e72876df5c4912f4d, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/40233.jpg?s=fa623bbfa3bd492b995e443cfe0ab312, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/68466.jpg?s=38838eeede066fae809195de7082d819, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/55888.jpg?s=add3cead4d10cc2ea45ac69cfce0cf84, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.gif?s=f7dcbc4a4603d18356d3dfef8abd655c"

Nanami is highly independent and strongly entrepreneurial, going so far as to take payment from the high school's Broadcast Club to grill her brother over the fraudulent election results on campus television. When she's sent to El-Hazard, she's initially alone and is forced to take on a waitressing job to earn enough money to travel, but she eventually meets up with Makoto and Fujisawa at the Fountain of Arliman, where she is able to start a small business selling boxed lunches to the visiting priestesses. Nanami has feelings for Makoto, but she's never really had the opportunity to talk about a relationship with him. 

Nanami's power gained upon entering El-Hazard is to see through the illusions of the Phantom Tribe, making her a viable defense against the greatest threat in the first OVA series. 

Nanami in The Wanderers 

The Phantom Tribe does not exist in the alternate timeline, and so instead Nanami has the same power to communicate with the Bugrom as her brother. Her past relationship with Makoto is also explored a bit more in detail, and she becomes good friends with Princess Rune Venus. As well, in the last episode of the TV series, Alielle describes Nanami and herself as ""special friends"", lending their relationship a certain homoerotic subtext, though this seems to be more along the lines of a big sister relationship.

When she first learns Makoto's true identity, she accuses him of being a pervert and tries to roast him, but after he saves her life when Ifurita awakens, she begins to have feelings for him. She also has a friendly rivalry with the wind priestess Afura Mann.

Shayla-Shayla in The Wanderers

Rather than be centralized in one location, the three priestesses each run a separate temple. Fittingly enough, Shayla's fire temple is located in a volcano. She is just as temper-driven as her OVA persona, but with the addition of being a heavy gambler. When Makoto and Fujisawa first meet her, she had lost her clothes and the entire temple to Jinnai in a rigged game.

When she's sent to El-Hazard, she's initially alone and is forced to take on a waitressing job to earn enough money to travel, but she eventually meets up with Makoto and Fujisawa at the Fountain of Arliman, where she is able to start a small business selling boxed lunches to the visiting priestesses. Nanami has feelings for Makoto, but she's never really had the opportunity to talk about a relationship with him. 

Nanami's power gained upon entering El-Hazard is to see through the illusions of the Phantom Tribe, making her a viable defense against the greatest threat in the first OVA series. 

Nanami in The Wanderers 

The Phantom Tribe does not exist in the alternate timeline, and so instead Nanami has the same power to communicate with the Bugrom as her brother. Her past relationship with Makoto is also explored a bit more in detail, and she becomes good friends with Princess Rune Venus. As well, in the last episode of the TV series, Alielle describes Nanami and herself as ""special friends"", lending their relationship a certain homoerotic subtext, though this seems to be more along the lines of a big sister relationship.

When Makoto catches wind of this and plans are made for him to testify against Jinnai (who is called ""Jinnai"" by everyone except his sister), the egocentric, power-hungry and soon-to-be-impeached Student Body President attempts to thwart the process by attacking Makoto, intending to keep him tied up until a technicality in the bylaws prevents him from being thrown out of office. Before he can execute his plan, however, he's sent to El-Hazard, and once there encounters the Bugrom, a race of human-sized insectoid beings ruled by Queen Diva.

Jinnai's power granted to him by the trip is the ability to communicate with the Bugrom, allowing him to become their military commander under their belief that he is the messenger from God sent to lead the Bugrom to victory. A skilled tactician, he is able to reorganize the Bugrom forces into an effective army and comes close to conquering El-Hazard.

Although Jinnai is a power-hungry egomaniac, he's not without some level of humanity. When Galus attempts to stop Makoto and the others from halting the Eye of God's apocalyptic malfunction, he takes the leader of the Phantom Tribe by surprise with the help of a Bugrom soldier. Although Jinnai effectively comes to Makoto and Nanami's rescue, he does so more for the fact that a ""true ruler doesn't destroy the land he wishes to conquer."" Jinnai has a very distinctive laugh.

Jinni suffers from an obsession with Makoto that borders of the psychotic. Over the course of both series, he consistently blames Makoto for essentially every single failure and disappointment he experiences. His sense of his own history is a montage of misfortune, the chief architect of which is Makoto. Though generally megalomaniacal, one of his primary motivations in gaining power is to subsequently gain the ability to best, or, even kill him.

Jinnai in The Wanderers

Jinnai does not change much in the transition from OVA to TV series, either, but he seems to treat Ifurita with more care. Although he's threatened with impeachment from his position as Student Body President at the beginning of the series and Makoto plays no direct role in the trial, he is paranoid that Makoto will replace him as president once he is kicked out of office.

Additionally, Jinnai reveals a softer side at the end of the series, showing a certain fatherly affection towards Ifurita after she stops the Eye of God from plowing into Roshtaria.   ~From Wikipedia",Main,"Okiayu, Ryoutarou, Klein, Robert Martin, Artaux, Cyrille","Japanese, English, French","https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/80436.jpg?s=db6e64580a47c97e72876df5c4912f4d, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/40233.jpg?s=fa623bbfa3bd492b995e443cfe0ab312, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/68466.jpg?s=38838eeede066fae809195de7082d819"

Holding true to the classic anime redhead stereotype, this tanned priestess' temper is as fiery as her hair, matching her control over the element of fire. Makoto, Fujisawa and Alielle first meet her when she rescues them from a Bugrom attack on Mt. Muldoon, but she runs off with Afura without hearing them out about their mission. When she first learns Makoto's true identity, she accuses him of being a pervert and tries to roast him, but after he saves her life when Ifurita awakens, she begins to have feelings for him. She also has a friendly rivalry with the wind priestess Afura Mann.

Shayla-Shayla in The Wanderers

Rather than be centralized in one location, the three priestesses each run a separate temple. Fittingly enough, Shayla's fire temple is located in a volcano. She is just as temper-driven as her OVA persona, but with the addition of being a heavy gambler. When Makoto and Fujisawa first meet her, she had lost her clothes and the entire temple to Jinnai in a rigged game.

With the exception of a few features, she has the external appearance of a beautiful woman and is the only fully humanoid member of the tribe, though this may possibly be an illusion, as with the case of the ruler of the Insects in the Alternate World of Creteria. When Katsuhiko arrives in El-Hazard and is brought before her by some of her soldiers, she becomes convinced that he is actually a messenger sent by God destined to lead the Bugrom to victory over their enemies in the Alliance. Impressed by Katsuhiko's ability to mobilize the troops and conquer nations with ease, she also becomes romantically interested in him. When the Bugrom homeland is annihilated by the Eye of God, she manages to avoid the attack with Jinnai's personal squad by traveling to deliver supplies to Katsuhiko on the frontline.

At the start of the Alternate World series, she is urged by Jinnai to produce eggs for the new colony they are constructing, due to the Bugrom having been decimated by the Eye of God- even though more survivors have found their way to the new colony, their numbers are still insufficient. However, much to Jinnai's horror, she needs to have a mate in order to give birth to a new generation, and Jinnai is the only male available at the time (at least, that is what she claims). Jinnai's attempt to escape her is why he and his squad are transported to Cretari. Once they return, however, Jinnai is dragged into Diva's amorous embrace.

Diva in The Wanderers

Diva is very much a background character in the OVA, and she doesn't have much more to do in The Wanderers, either. However, the relationship between her, Jinnai and the bubble-headed Ifurita does take on a rather comedic family dynamic. Also, The Wanderers is the only El-Hazard series in which Diva encounters a human character without a special power to understand the Bugrom language.

His true name is Houjun Ri (李 芳准, Ri Hōjun?), born under the star Well (井).

As the oldest and wisest of all of the Suzaku warriors, Chichiri thinks of himself as the older brother who looks after them all. Appearing superficially light-hearted, he can put on super deformed 'chibi' frivolity or suddenly be very serious and grim. While Tamahome and Hotohori are the obvious leaders, Chichiri is the ever-staunch adviser and supporter from behind the scenes, always willing to help when needed. Unconcerned with his own mortality or with earthly desires, he has a Zen master's detached attitude. He habitually ends many sentences with the emphatic phrase ""no da"", translated as ""ya know"" in the anime's English version (omitted in the English dub).

His true name is Juan Myō (妙 寿安, Myou Juan?), born the star Chariot (軫). Mitsukake's fighting abilities are limited to his own strength, but as a Celestial Warrior, he possesses incredible healing powers at the cost of exchanging some of his own life force. He uses this ability frequently to heal minor injuries, but after healing life-threatening injuries, Mitsukake requires an entire day to regenerate his life force. His cat Tama is the unofficial mascot of the Suzaku Celestial Warriors and, after Mitsukake's death, becomes Chichiri's pet.

The son of a country doctor, he put his natural talents to work and often would help his father with his rounds. His father eventually died attempting to save villagers close to a flooding river during the same storm that claimed the lives of Chichiri's loved ones. Mitsukake shows utter devotion to healing; however after the death of Shōka, the daughter of the local nobleman who he was in love with, Mitsukake gave up medicine and dedicated all of his time and energy into finding a miracle herb that could cure any illness. It was during this reclusive stage that Miaka and the others find him, and managed to get him to join them with little persuasion. However, he continues to cherish the memory of the late Shōka.

Despite his expressionless appearance and tendency to remain silent, Mitsukake is a kind-hearted and calm man who seems aloof, but is actually shy and does not know how to be more outgoing. He is especially kind to the weak, elderly, the sickly, and children, as well as animals. During the battle between Konan and Kutō, he is severely wounded by Nakago.

Nakago is considered to be the leader of the Seiryuu warriors, is the main antagonist  of Fushigi Yuugi. His true name is Ayuru Gi, born under the star Heart. 

Nakago is both merciless and charismatic; he eliminates those whose usefulness to him is exhausted and skillfully manipulates others into doing as he wishes. Nakago's powers as a Celestial Warrior is shown to be stronger than any of the Suzaku and Seiryū warriors, having the ability to manipulate chi, enabling himself to become psychokinetic, fire energy blasts, and set up force fields. In battle, Nakago also utilizes a whip and sword.

As Kuto's highest ranking general, Nakago commands two thirds of Kuto's army. The last of the Hin Tribe—a people destroyed at the orders of the Emperor of Kuto—Nakago was captured after seeing his mother being raped by Kutō soldiers, triggered his powers and killed the soldiers and his own mother. With the surviving soldiers recognizing him as a Celestial Warrior, Nakago is brought to the Emperor where his natural beauty results in his being sexually abused by the Emperor. As he mastered complete control over his abilities, he eventually became a seemingly loyal soldier of Kuto, with the Emperor unaware that Nakago has been planning to betray him all his life.

- His qualities include: hard working, greedy, caring, strong, compassionate, loyal, funny, determined, courageous.
- His two most favorite things are money and Miaka. 
- He is one of the seven star warriors of Suzaku and bears the sign ‘oni’ on his forehead. Which is best translated as 'ogre' or 'demon' and in chinese: 'ghost'. Because of this, he is greatly misunderstood and was even teased in childhood! 
- His blood type is O, he is 180 cm tall or 5’11 and he was born on June 28, thus being a cancer.

Tamahome (鬼宿?), the first of the seven Celestial Warriors of Suzaku whom Miaka meets, comes into the story when he saves Miaka and Yui from slave-traders. Born in the country of Kounan (Hong-nan) Village of the Juusou (Shou-Shuang) as the eldest son of a large family, he is seventeen years old. His true name is Kishuku Sou (琮 鬼宿, Sō Kishuku?)  , based on the star Demon (鬼).

Tamahome appears the strongest member of the Suzaku warriors. An adept martial artist, proficient unarmed and with weapons, he proves a good street-fighter and can channel his ki into energy-blasts. When emotionally motivated, he is able to use his ki to increase his strength, speed, and reflexes in combat. Tamahome is also experienced in fencing thanks to being trained by Tokaki.

Initially, the story portrays Tamahome as a greedy young man, interested in helping others only if it means getting paid for it later. It is eventually revealed that his interest in accumulating money derives from trying to support his family. He comes across as cheerful, vain, and comic, but is actually shy and emotionally strong. Throughout the series, he demonstrates himself to be a sincere young man who is willing to sacrifice himself for the sake of others and unwilling to back down from enemies.

Extremely quick and agile, he particularly enjoys joking around with Nuriko, Tamahome, and Chichiri. He is 17 years old and was born in the town of Tai-Tou in the Ko prefecture, at the foot of Mount Reikaku. His true name is Shun&amp;#039;u Kou (侯 俊宇, Kō Shun&amp;#039;u?), born under the star Wings (翼). Tasuki&amp;#039;s primary weapon is a flame throwing Tessen, an iron fan used for fighting which is eventually upgraded to become a diamond fan that could only be used by Tasuki by Taitsukun. Additionally, he is skilled in judo, archery, swordsmanship, and is briefly capable of using ofuda. As a Celestial Warrior, he possesses superhuman speed and known as Genrou or Huang-Lang (幻狼|""Phantom Wolf"") because of his wolf-like appearance.

At a young age Tasuki found his calling as a bandit when Hakurō, the chief bandit of Mount Reikaku, took him under his wing. He began to improve his martial arts abilities in hopes of living up to and carrying on the role of his mentor[2]. He and fellow bandit Kōji eventually master the use of an iron fan in combat. Tasuki first meets Miaka when he kidnaps her in order to regain his rightful place as the leader of Mount Reikaku&amp;#039;s bandits. He eventually joins her in order to help the other Celestial Warriors on their quest, reluctantly leaving Kōji as the leader of the bandits of Mount Reikaku.

Straight-forward, simple-minded, and quick to pick a fight, Tasuki also has a strong sense of honour. Though he appears utterly blunt, vulgar, and loud, he is sentimental and easily emotional. He is a frequent source of comic relief in the series and enjoys joking around. Tasuki values his friends greatly and will not hesitate to kill those who would try to endanger them or make fun of them in any way. Despite being rough around the edges, Tasuki shares a particularly strong relationship with Chiriko. Tasuki, as the youngest child and only son of a family with five older sisters, an aggressive mother, and timid father, happily accepts the role of an older brother figure to Chiriko, who looks up to him and strives to become a ""manly man"" like Tasuki. Of all the Suzaku Celestial Warriors, he takes the deaths of his comrades the hardest and openly cries for them. A running joke in the series is that Tasuki is afraid to swim, claiming that it is because he is a ""man of the mountains"", though on several occasions he is able to instinctively tread water and finds unusual means of compensating for his weakness.

As the youngest and only son in a family with strong females and a weak father, Tasuki claims to hate women. But he demonstrates outstanding loyalty to Miaka and would die to protect her. His feelings toward her are apparently brotherly, but it is eventually revealed that he loves her. He acts on these feelings only once, when under a spell, but unwilling to betray his friends and aware of his behaviour, he attempts to kill himself, saved only when the spell is broken.

Miaka Yuuki (夕城 美朱), the primary protagonist in Fushigi Yûgi, an ordinary fifteen year old junior high school student, initially decides to become the Priestess of Suzaku  (Suzaku no Miko) in order to use one of the wishes she will receive when she summons Suzaku: she plans to enter the high school of her choice and be with her friend Yui.

Outgoing and optimistic, Miaka shows herself amiable with friends and strangers, and has a tendency to be guileless and sentimental. She is naïve, but sometimes surprises adults with an insightful comment. Miaka is generous and cares greatly for other people and perceives herself to be a considerate person. She can be unassuming and unsophisticated, but also magnanimous and courageous. Because she creates the impression of a person who always needs help, Miaka has the good fortune of almost always having someone looking after her.

Miaka has a primary weakness: her gluttony. She eats constantly and has an interest in any type of food. She is an avid fan of anime, imitating several characters during the course of the story.

A 24 year-old native of a village on the Shōryū River (near the northern Kōnan-Kutō border), he variously wields a shakujō staff, kasa hat, and kesa mantle to fight and employs various magical techniques taught by Taiitsukun, the first of which was the ability to form a barrier around himself. His true name is Houjun Ri (李 芳准, Ri Hōjun?), born under the star Well (井).

As the oldest and wisest of all of the Suzaku warriors, Chichiri thinks of himself as the older brother who looks after them all. Appearing superficially light-hearted, he can put on super deformed 'chibi' frivolity or suddenly be very serious and grim. While Tamahome and Hotohori are the obvious leaders, Chichiri is the ever-staunch adviser and supporter from behind the scenes, always willing to help when needed. Unconcerned with his own mortality or with earthly desires, he has a Zen master's detached attitude. He habitually ends many sentences with the emphatic phrase ""no da"", translated as ""ya know"" in the anime's English version (omitted in the English dub).

Chiriko's intelligence actually derives from his role as a Celestial Warrior and when his character disappears, he becomes a rather average child with limited intelligence.

He is particularly sensitive about his height and his peculiar intelligence and strives towards becoming a ""man of strength"", but is otherwise a quiet and good-natured student.

His true name is Juan Myō (妙 寿安, Myou Juan?), born the star Chariot (軫). Mitsukake's fighting abilities are limited to his own strength, but as a Celestial Warrior, he possesses incredible healing powers at the cost of exchanging some of his own life force. He uses this ability frequently to heal minor injuries, but after healing life-threatening injuries, Mitsukake requires an entire day to regenerate his life force. His cat Tama is the unofficial mascot of the Suzaku Celestial Warriors and, after Mitsukake's death, becomes Chichiri's pet.

The son of a country doctor, he put his natural talents to work and often would help his father with his rounds. His father eventually died attempting to save villagers close to a flooding river during the same storm that claimed the lives of Chichiri's loved ones. Mitsukake shows utter devotion to healing; however after the death of Shōka, the daughter of the local nobleman who he was in love with, Mitsukake gave up medicine and dedicated all of his time and energy into finding a miracle herb that could cure any illness. It was during this reclusive stage that Miaka and the others find him, and managed to get him to join them with little persuasion. However, he continues to cherish the memory of the late Shōka.

Despite his expressionless appearance and tendency to remain silent, Mitsukake is a kind-hearted and calm man who seems aloof, but is actually shy and does not know how to be more outgoing. He is especially kind to the weak, elderly, the sickly, and children, as well as animals. During the battle between Konan and Kutō, he is severely wounded by Nakago.

Tamahome (鬼宿?), the first of the seven Celestial Warriors of Suzaku whom Miaka meets, comes into the story when he saves Miaka and Yui from slave-traders. Born in the country of Kounan (Hong-nan) Village of the Juusou (Shou-Shuang) as the eldest son of a large family, he is seventeen years old. His true name is Kishuku Sou (琮 鬼宿, Sō Kishuku?)  , based on the star Demon (鬼).

Tamahome appears the strongest member of the Suzaku warriors. An adept martial artist, proficient unarmed and with weapons, he proves a good street-fighter and can channel his ki into energy-blasts. When emotionally motivated, he is able to use his ki to increase his strength, speed, and reflexes in combat. Tamahome is also experienced in fencing thanks to being trained by Tokaki.

Initially, the story portrays Tamahome as a greedy young man, interested in helping others only if it means getting paid for it later. It is eventually revealed that his interest in accumulating money derives from trying to support his family. He comes across as cheerful, vain, and comic, but is actually shy and emotionally strong. Throughout the series, he demonstrates himself to be a sincere young man who is willing to sacrifice himself for the sake of others and unwilling to back down from enemies.

Extremely quick and agile, he particularly enjoys joking around with Nuriko, Tamahome, and Chichiri. He is 17 years old and was born in the town of Tai-Tou in the Ko prefecture, at the foot of Mount Reikaku. His true name is Shun&amp;#039;u Kou (侯 俊宇, Kō Shun&amp;#039;u?), born under the star Wings (翼). Tasuki&amp;#039;s primary weapon is a flame throwing Tessen, an iron fan used for fighting which is eventually upgraded to become a diamond fan that could only be used by Tasuki by Taitsukun. Additionally, he is skilled in judo, archery, swordsmanship, and is briefly capable of using ofuda. As a Celestial Warrior, he possesses superhuman speed and known as Genrou or Huang-Lang (幻狼|""Phantom Wolf"") because of his wolf-like appearance.

At a young age Tasuki found his calling as a bandit when Hakurō, the chief bandit of Mount Reikaku, took him under his wing. He began to improve his martial arts abilities in hopes of living up to and carrying on the role of his mentor[2]. He and fellow bandit Kōji eventually master the use of an iron fan in combat. Tasuki first meets Miaka when he kidnaps her in order to regain his rightful place as the leader of Mount Reikaku&amp;#039;s bandits. He eventually joins her in order to help the other Celestial Warriors on their quest, reluctantly leaving Kōji as the leader of the bandits of Mount Reikaku.

Straight-forward, simple-minded, and quick to pick a fight, Tasuki also has a strong sense of honour. Though he appears utterly blunt, vulgar, and loud, he is sentimental and easily emotional. He is a frequent source of comic relief in the series and enjoys joking around. Tasuki values his friends greatly and will not hesitate to kill those who would try to endanger them or make fun of them in any way. Despite being rough around the edges, Tasuki shares a particularly strong relationship with Chiriko. Tasuki, as the youngest child and only son of a family with five older sisters, an aggressive mother, and timid father, happily accepts the role of an older brother figure to Chiriko, who looks up to him and strives to become a ""manly man"" like Tasuki. Of all the Suzaku Celestial Warriors, he takes the deaths of his comrades the hardest and openly cries for them. A running joke in the series is that Tasuki is afraid to swim, claiming that it is because he is a ""man of the mountains"", though on several occasions he is able to instinctively tread water and finds unusual means of compensating for his weakness.

As the youngest and only son in a family with strong females and a weak father, Tasuki claims to hate women. But he demonstrates outstanding loyalty to Miaka and would die to protect her. His feelings toward her are apparently brotherly, but it is eventually revealed that he loves her. He acts on these feelings only once, when under a spell, but unwilling to betray his friends and aware of his behaviour, he attempts to kill himself, saved only when the spell is broken.

Yui Hongo  is the Priestess of Seiryuu. An intelligent and mature girl, she is a tenth grade student and Miaka Yūki&amp;#039;s best friend. A passionate person at heart, she tends to see the world in black and white terms and is easily infuriated with perceived betrayal. Yui is confident and bold with everything she does, but longs for someone to take care of her. It is revealed in the manga that Yui cut her hair to avoid all the attention she was getting from boys.

Yui is initially transported to ""The Universe of Four Gods"" with Miaka, but almost immediately returns to the real world and becomes the one who reads the book in order for events in the world to progress. However, she becomes trapped in the book while trying to help Miaka return to the real world. Afterwards, bandits capture Yui and knock her unconscious. When she regains consciousness, she believes she has been raped and, distraught, attempts to kill herself. Nakago rescues her and convinces her that Miaka is responsible for Yui&amp;#039;s misfortunes, leaving Yui unaware that Nakago had saved her before the incident involving the bandits and that she had not been raped at all. He manipulates Yui into becoming the Priestess of Seiryū, convincing her that it will allow Yui to take revenge on Miaka.

Aozaru (青猿, Azure Monkey) is the physical manifestation of the sentient spirit of the scabbard of the Suigūtō (the Water Monkey Sword). The sword is a royal treasure to the kingdom of Kei and can only be wielded by the kingdom's rightful ruler - as such, Youko is the only one who can draw the sword from its sheath. The sword was forged from a water demon that a previous great ruler of Kei had defeated while the scabbard was created from a long-tailed monkey demon. From the scabbard hangs a large jewel that can heal the one who holds it.

The sword is not only capable of killing demons and sages and breaking substances like metal chains, but is also capable of presenting visions of the past, future, and things in the distance. The sword and scabbard must be kept together, otherwise the phantasms of the sword appear unchecked while the spirit of the scabbard is free to act as it wishes. When Youko loses the scabbard, it appears in the form of Aozaru, the blue monkey, and taunts her with her doubts while the sword presents her with visions of things she does not wish to see. Eventually, Youko, overcoming her own doubts, kills the monkey and picks up the dead scabbard. Because she has killed Aozaru, the sword can be drawn from the sheath by anyone, though it can be wielded effectively only by Youko.

The Minister is depicted as a woman in the anime; the Minister of Law's gender in the novel is not stated.

The Minister of Law is aligned with Seikyou's faction in the court, thus she does not enforce the law if it will further solidify Seikyou's power in court. In the anime, she openly undermines Youko's ability to discern who can be trusted in court by suggesting that ministers in the faction opposing Seikyou are against Youko and her attempts to reform the court.

In both the novel and the anime, Youko suspects that she cannot truly trust any of the ministers in her court as they are either aligned with Seikyou or opposed to him. In light of the accusations against Koukan, the governor of Baku, and the Sankou and the death of the Taisai, the minister serving as the Palace Administrator and Seikyou's most vocal opponent, Youko immediately exiles Koukan and the Sankou and demotes all the members of Seikyou's faction. Seikyou is forced to become the Palace Administrator while the Minister of Law, along with the Ministers of Rites and Lands, are demoted to the positions of the Sankou.

In the anime, the Minister of Law remains as Seikyou's most visible ally and conspires with him and takes advantage of Youko's disappearance from court to maintain their power. At the end of both the novel and the anime, the Ministry of Law is threatened by Youko into ensuring that the law is properly enforced and punishment is delivered, reminding the Minister of Law and the Ministry of Justice that she was responsible for ordering the arrest of Seikyou and his cronies. The anime depicts the events similarly, with the Minister of Law's response to Youko's threat being quickly silence with the same reminder of that the monarch had ordered Seikyou's arrest.

When Youko leaves to visit Takuhou and Meikaku, the rike is attacked by Shoukou's men; Rangyoka is killed, Keikei is injured, and Enho is abducted and taken to Gahou. Youko moves to rescue Enho and learns from Suzu that Shoukou has taken Enho. When she captures Shoukou, he reveals that Enho is held by Gahou.

Apart from the fact that each use of these powers permanently weakens her physical state, she has also found that the initial gratitude people show for the use of these powers later turns violent when she refuses to use them.

Sign: Aries

Prince of Fanelia, pilot of Escaflowne, Van Fanel suddenly appears on Earth one day, fighting a Dragon. His life narrowly saved by Hitomi, a schoolgirl caught up in the battle, Van returns to his kingdom only for it to be torched to the ground a few days later. Van vows revenge on the perpetrators—the Zaibach Empire—even when he finds that Folken, his supposedly dead elder-brother, is working for them. With Hitomi's help, Van hones his fighting abilities and begins to predict his opponent's moves, giving him the upper hand: he is however, deeply effected by his blood-pact with Escaflowne, which requires that he shares the bodily damage it suffers in battle. 


Van Fanel is the young half-Draconian king of Fanelia who must learn to cope with drastic changes in his life after Fanelia is destroyed by Zaibach. He pilots Escaflowne, a Guymelef made by the mysterious Ispano tribe which can transform into a flying dragon. He earns his right to pilot Escaflowne through a blood pact which connects his body and soul to Escaflowne. Due to the blood pact and Hitomi's influence, Van becomes injured when the Escaflowne is damaged, and these wounds will not close until Escaflowne is repaired. Consequently, if Escaflowne is destroyed, Van will die.

His destiny and Hitomi's are linked, and he is initially dependent on Hitomi's clairvoyant abilities, which save his life more than once. He also holds a grudge against Folken for leaving his native kingdom of Fanelia for Zaibach and Dornkirk for his grand ambitions. Due to being half-Draconian, Van is able to manifest a pair of feathered wings which enable him to fly.

When he was younger, his little sister Celena was kidnapped by Zaibach, his father disappeared mysteriously, and his mother died shortly afterwards. He has captured the heart of Princess Millerna of Asturia, but also demonstrates strong feelings for Hitomi as the series progresses. Allen deeply resents his father, Leon, for abandoning his family to search for the secrets of Atlantis.

He was a gifted swordsman at a young age, becoming one of the most skilled fighters of Gaea under the expert tutelage of Balgus of Fanelia. During his early knight career he and Princess Marlene fell in love and she bore his child, Chid. Later within the series, Allen briefly becomes romantically involved with Hitomi through Dornkirk's influence and proposes to her.

Yasuaki is an Onmyōji, and the successor to the famous, historical Onmyōji Abe no Seimei.

Unlike his fellow Hachiyou, Yasuaki was not ""born"" a human, but created through Abe no Seimei's magical skill, and crafted into his current form through that same ability (in the manga he even talks about Seimei using a Tengu's power to help form him, although this is not explained in the anime). For this reason, despite having the physical appearance of a twenty one year old adult male, Yasuaki has only actually been alive for two years. This in many ways explains his emotional simplicity and naivety, since he has not yet learnt many of the things his companions have grown up absorbing.

For the most part, Yasuaki is a composed, detached individual that operates largely on logic and is sometimes perceived as cold or strange. When it appears that Eisen will die if he exorcises the eight-stringed Kin, Yasuaki states the fact bluntly and without any concern because he sees it simply in black and white - to save the Miko, a Hachiyou must be prepared to do his duty. As he puts it - ""If there is no Miko, there is no point in the Hachiyou."" 

When Yasuaki was ""born"", Seimei told him he had been born to find someone important to him, and that he lacked something as a person - a heart - which could not be crafted. For this reason, Yasuaki has accepted his master's words as meaning he's not a ""real person"", and therefore does not count in the same way as his Hachiyou companions. He believes he is the Miko's ""tool"" - in the manga, he is worried that he is ""broken"" because he can no longer read Akane's heart (although Akane explains to him that that just makes him like every other person, and that he's not broken at all)

In the anime he tells her that ""a tool that no longer works has no option but to be destroyed"" after Shirin tells him that he will never be able to find the Northern Seal. In the anime, his ignorance of human feelings make him tell Ran the memories that to that point had been concealed from her, driving her back to the Oni clan and causing a lot of trouble for the Hachiyou. In the manga, it is when he releases Kotengu's seal and sends him into battle against Ikutidaru, only to have the creature apparently slain at the demon's hands.

Yasuaki has many odd habits during the anime and the manga - including talking to trees, possessing small animals to convey messages and even casting spell dolls to help him do the cleaning. Although undoubtedly the most powerful of the Hachiyou at the start, he is also probably the most vulnerable on account of his background and his origins.

Yasuaki's developmental stages and childlike naivety are more clearly outlined in the manga, also - at one point, he asks why people tell lies, but later winds up lying to Akane himself to protect her from the grief of Kotengu's apparent passing away. This act tortures him for some time afterwards and he withdraws from Akane's company completely, convinced she must be angry with him for telling her a lie.

Yasuaki's most commonly said phrase in the manga and the anime is (mondai nai - no problem), a catchphrase which was even picked up on and exploited in one of the live Haruka Matsuri festas. He also often says (wakaranai - I don't understand) - usually when relating to some human nuance that he hasn't managed to grasp yet.",Main,"Ishida, Akira, du Pac, Benoît","Japanese, French","https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/62624.jpg?s=e177139a222a21c2cd73e39e54187aef, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/32079.jpg?s=1ce8ab1eec5454a766ca83088ca4a3b9"

Hair Color: Black
Eye Color: Black
Weight: 52 kg
Status: Demon King (Maoh), engaged to Wolfram von Bielefeld.
Clothing: Black Japanese School Uniform described by von Christ as cloaked in the night.

The stories protagonist. Born and grew up in Saitama prefecture. A high school student who enjoys baseball more than textbooks. He was 'named' by Conrad when he mentioned to Yuri's mother how, where he comes from, Yuri means July. Early in the show, bullies make fun of Yuri's name by calling him ""Shibuya Yūri, Harajuku Fūri"" (advantage Shibuya, disadvantage Harajuku)—a reference to popular districts of Tokyo. In the English dub, this becomes a pun on ""Yuri is short for urine.""

When Yuri arrives in Shin Makoku, he is declared the 27th Maoh of the Mazoku (""Demon Race""). Yuri easily gets caught up in his emotions to the point of losing control of himself. He is a little bit quick to anger, and once he's on a rampage he can't even stop himself. A music teacher he once had dubbed his rants ""the Turkish march."" When he is angry or sad or has a strong emotion his natural powers emerge. Yuri uses expressions from historical dramas when he gets this way, which probably has to do with the fact that he loves historical dramas. They call this condition is sometimes called ""Maou mode"" (「上様モード」 in Japanese, ""emperor mode""). In the anime this form can be recognized mainly by the longer hair and demon eyes. He can summon powerful magic (majutsu), even in the human territories (a notable feat as most Mazoku cannot perform magic outside their country), and even more remarkable he can use majutsu in souseki filled areas such as the souseki mines where other mazoku have difficulty standing and even breathing. Yuri's magic is manifested in various shapes—usually one or more great water dragons, or some messy magical ""creature"" made from mud, food morsels etc. After spending time in this form, Yuri becomes worn out and in some cases passes out and doesn't remember what happened afterwards. Later, Yuri learns to control his power and uses it to close the first of the Forbidden Boxes. In the beginning of season 1, he often fainted after he used Maryokou (especially in Human land) due to exhaustion. But later on he was able to maintain his consciousness after returning to his ""former self.""

Yuri has many allies and friends. His closest allies are Wolfram, Conrad, Günter, Gwendal, Murata, and Josak. They help Yuri throughout the series. At his first encounter with Wolfram von Bielefeld he ends up engaged to him due to a mishap: Wolfram, angry that Yuri has been chosen as the Maoh, makes the mistake of insulting Yuri's mother—which earns him a slap. Slapping another noble on his or her left cheek is the way in which Mazoku propose marriage (some consider the slap as unmanly, but Yuri explains in the light novel that he only slapped Wolfram because he has a beautiful face, otherwise he would have punched him). Incensed by this insult, Wolfram challenges Yuri to a duel, which is also mistakenly accepted because of Yuri's unfamiliarity with Mazoku custom (he picked up the knife that fell off the table).



Throughout the series, his main goal is to create a world in which Mazoku and humans can live together in peace, something that progresses slowly but surely as the series goes on.

Wolfram is a mazoku man who finds himself engaged to Yuuri after a cultural mistake. He is a ""bishounen,"" which means a pretty or beautiful boy. He is quite androgynous looking, with a notably beautiful face, shoulder-length hair and long eyelashes. His appearance is so influential, that several dying people in the hospital have a miraculous recovery after laying eyes on him. Wolfram possesses fire magic, as well as being adept with a sword. He is the half-brother of Conrad and Gwendal. He has extremely high pride as a demon and is hot-headed. He is arrogant and short-tempered but can also show a compassionate side at times. He is the only one of the previous queen's three sons who inherited her emerald green eyes and blonde hair, bearing a striking resemblance to her. In his mother's words, it seems he inherited his looks from her but his temperamental personality from his late father. Wolfram is obsessed with Yuuri and insists on following him everywhere as he claims it is his duty to protect his fiancé, though he also seems to want to prevent him from cheating on him. His ancestor, Rufus Bielefield, fought alongside the Original King (the great one).

Near the end of the second season, there is a time when Wolfram is possessed by Original King, who in turned was possessed by Soushu. The key he possesses, his heart, is ripped out by Original King in order to open one of the four boxes, ""Hellfire in Frozen Land"" (""Hellfire on Frozen Tundra"" in Japanese translation). Because of this, Wolfram temporarily dies, but is revived when the Original King returns the keys to their owners.

Wolfram is the youngest son of the former Maou, Cecilie von Spitzweig. He initially dislikes humans, even Conrad's father. Because of his mazoku pride, he does not like to admit that Conrad is his brother, even though he cares for Conrad (Wolfram always referred to Conrad by his last name—Lord Weller; however, after Conrad's return from his supposed betrayal, Wolfram refers to Conrad by his first name). In the graphic novels, it is hinted that this hatred towards humans stems from his late father's prejudice against humans. His liking for humans improves throughout the series, progressing to the point that he adopts the human girl Greta as his daughter, starts acknowledging Yuuri's parents as his future ""in-laws"" and also runs into a raging fire to save a human child.

Years ago when he was a child, Wolfram accidentally slapped Elizabeth, Raven's niece, on her left cheek. Elizabeth never forgot this incident, insisting that they swore everlasting love that day, while Wolfram insists he forgot why he slapped her in the first place. Some time after collecting three of the Four Forbidden Boxes, Elizabeth becomes Stoffel's tool to separate Yuuri from the three brothers, pronouncing an engagement proposal to Yuuri. Elizabeth's real goal is to marry Wolfram, but Wolfram says that his only fiance is Yuuri. During the duel which ensues, (as Yuuri accidentally picked up a knife and a fork pointing it at Elizabeth; symbolizing a fight to settle a triangle love affair), Yuuri turns into the Maou, protecting Wolfram from being hurt by fire majutsu that Elizabeth summoned. He proclaims the two go on the date and remember their childhood memories. It is eventually learned that Wolfram slapped Elizabeth because he wanted to touch a butterfly that flew past, and Conrad was watching the entire event.

Wolfram is an extremely ""pretty"" person—Yuuri calls him this upon first meeting him (specifically using the term ""bishōnen"" in the Japanese version and very often in the light novel). This is also why Yuuri slapped Wolfram when he badmouthed Yuuri's mother instead of punching him, stating that it's a pity to dirty such a pretty face (Source: the novels). This image is enhanced by his choice of nightwear—a frilly nightgown that contrasts violently with his rather quick temper.

When he first becomes engaged to Yuuri, he is extremely upset, but the idea quickly grows on him. He takes the engagement much more seriously than Yuuri does. He follows Yuuri practically everywhere so he can keep an eye on him and even sneaks into Yuuri's bedroom at night. He gets extremely jealous when Yuuri talks to a girl or good-looking guy and often accuses him of being unfaithful which is sometimes used as comic relief, but as a character he is popular between fans and is considered to be the anime's breakout character. Even if he does not like to admit it, the series hints that Wolfram deeply cares about Yuuri. He tends to think Yuuri can be saved from bad situations because of his cuteness. By the end of the anime, he is making blatant declarations of love.

A major weakness is that he gets sea-sick. Yuuri also says that Wolfram cannot paint well, even though he insists on painting. It is revealed that Wolfram used to paint impressively realistic portraits of his family, but got bored of realism at some point and decided to adopt a more abstract art style, much to Yuuri's disappointment.

During the end of season two and the beginning of season three, Wolfram is chosen by the Ten Noble Families of Shin Makoku (Christ, Voltaire, Grantz, Bielefeld, Karbelnikoff, Wincott, Spitzberg, Gyllenhaal, Rochefort, and Radford) to become the next Maou, due to the belief that Yuuri would not be able to return to Shin Makoku at the time. When Yuuri does in fact return, Wolfram's uncle, Waltorana, places pressure on Wolfram to obtain the throne. Because of this, Wolfram dissolves the engagement with Yuuri and travels back to his homelands, in hopes that he would not be used to sabotage Yuuri.

Discovering of Wolfram's predicament, Yuuri and his retainers travel to the Bielefeld lands in the hopes of persuading Wolfram to return to Blood Pledge Castle, only to be forced into a formal duel by Wolfram himself. The battle becomes quite intense, as Wolfram gives his all against Yuuri and Yuuri trying his best to persuade Wolfram to stop the duel. At the climax, Yuuri was forced to protect himself by becoming the Maou and, angered by Wolfram's reckless dueling, prepares to hit Wolfram with a potentially fatal attack. In the process of hitting Wolfram with the attack, Yuuri watched as Wolfram prepared himself for what seems to be his last moment and gave his final words to Yuuri: ""Yuuri. Be a good king."" Realizing that Wolfram had planned the whole thing from the beginning so Yuuri could remain the Maou, Yuuri absorbed the attack onto himself at the last moment, sparring Wolfram of the damage. The Ten Noble Families then changed their decision to keep Yuuri as their king and Waltorana steps down from forcing Wolfram onto the throne. After a reconciliation between the two, Wolfram happily decides to annul the disengagement to a comically shocked Yuuri and proceeds to return to his normal attitude towards their engagement.

During the course of the series, Wolfram has grown exponentially from a spoiled prince to a selfless young man who stands by Yuuri with no question. Though, he had no plans of becoming Maou in the first place, he was willing to protect and serve Shin Makoku when it was resolved that Yuuri would not be returning back at the end of the second season, wanting to protect the beautiful job Yuuri did as Maou.

A teacher and swordsman who adores Yuuri. Günter is a skilled swordsman and magician but has retired to teach Yuuri about Shin Makoku and his future duties as the Maou. Günter once stated that he was the one who taught Conrad to ""become His Majesty's sword and shield"" indicating that perhaps Günter was once Conrad's teacher. When Günter accidentally travels to Earth, he becomes a model in New York City for a brief period of time so that he can earn money to find Yuuri. He is a very whimsical person and poetic in his thoughts. Günter is another test subject of Anissina.

Günter, along with the three brothers, helps Yuuri run the country. He is Yuuri's adviser and mentor, teaching him about various aspects of Shin Makoku. He usually spends his time doing numerous duties for both Yuuri and Shin Makoku.

When Günter was shot with a poisoned arrow containing the Wincott poison, his soul was temporarily housed in an Okiku Doll that flies, shoots lasers from its eyes, and has hair that grows naturally. During this time his body was known as Snow Günter and could be controlled by or released from the effects of the Wincott poison by anyone of the Von Wincott bloodline, like Julia's father and nephew.

Günter's personality is usually that of a good nature, but when he puts on his serious face he can be awe-inspiring. He has an extremely strong attachment to Yuuri and tends to pine when Yuuri has been gone from Shin Makoku for any considerable amount of time. He is very popular among women and men because of his good looks.

Günter's political views make a radical change due to Yuuri's influence. In the beginning, he was the one pushing most strongly for the war that would exterminate the human race. As the series goes on Yuuri's views are impressed upon him, and he begins to truly believe in and work for a peaceful alliance between Mazoku and humans.

Günter's only family seems to be his adopted daughter Gisela.

From the beginning, Gwendal has objections to Yuri becoming the Maoh. He is a skilled tactician and is capable of using earth magic and can cast barriers. When not otherwise busy, Gwendal indulges in his hobby of knitting and sewing but often his creatures look nothing like what they're supposed to (for example a bear got mistaken for a black pig or a cat that looks like a raccoon). He is adamnant that knitting helps him sharpen his concentration but actually its a stress reliever for him since childhood. He is also quite fond of cute animals or cute objects such as the dolphin keychain (Bandou-kun) Yuri received at the dolphin show and later gave to him. His childhood best friend is Anissina von Karbelnikoff, an inventor who often tests out her inventions on him, much to his displeasure. Anissina is also the one who taught Gwendal how to knit. Gwendal's left eye is a key to one of the four Forbidden Boxes, the ""End of the Earth"".

Gwendal is a tough guy except when it comes to his childhood friend, Anissina, and his brothers. He is afraid of Anissina and often hides from her so he can prevent being used in one of her crazy experiments. He is even seen sweating in panic at the thought of her. While he does not outwardly show much affection towards his brothers, he shows in times of great stress that he does care, an example being his decision to stand against the Original King to save his little brother, Wolfram. Jozak, who was sent to locate one of the Four Forbidden Boxes, tells Conrad that Gwendal really cares for Conrad's wellbeing and doesn't want Conrad to worry despite the Original King's wishes for Conrad to find the Boxes. His ancestor, Siegbert Voltaire, fought along the Original King.

When he was younger, Gwendal despised humans, a habit called the Mazoku Pride by Dunheely Weller. On Dunheely's last journey to a nameless village, he told Gwendal to enjoy the ride before their last duel. Upon arriving in the village, Gwendal is shocked that the village isn't recognized by Shin Makoku, and leads the attack on the bandits which targeted the village. In this duel, Gwendal sees Dunheely for who he really was, an old man, not the agile man he knew when he was younger. Dunheely later dies of old age, and Gwendal buries him near the tree where Dunheely told Gwendal what he was looking for. Years later while on a picnic with his family and Yuri, Gwendal admits that Dunheely was a larger existence than anyone else within him, because he hated that man.

Gwendal has no interest in love affairs, and even points out that issues coming from love affairs are beyond his abilities to influence. He does occasionally show care towards Greta, often being in charge of her while Yuri and Wolfram are in one of their adventures. Gwendal knows how to bake, as he does so for Greta when Günter, who would usually bake cookies for Greta, leaves the castle for a short journey. Greta comments that Gwendal's cookies look cute while Yuri comments Gwendal is good at baking as Gwendal's cookies are made into animal shapes, similar to the ones he knits. When Greta asks Gwendal if she is disturbing him while he is doing work, Gwendal says ""Since it's you, I don't mind"".

He is the commander of the demon army and often comes with reinforcements when Yuri finds himself in big trouble. He is also the one who does the paperwork and essentially runs the kingdom for Yuri. Often enough, when Yuri leaves the castle, Gunter is seen barging into Gwendal's office, demanding where Yuri is. Gwendal would usually look tired and suggest an idea which sounds appealing to Gunter, for example locking Yuri up in a room where no one will interfere.

Conrad is a swordsman (""the best swordsman in Shin Makoku"" - according to Wolfram) who looks after Yuuri. He possesses no maryoku (demonic magic) due to his mixed heritage of human and mazoku. His given name is Conrart; Yuuri nicknames him ""Conrad,"" which is ""closer to English"" and easier to pronounce with a Japanese tongue. Conrad is the second child of the previous Maou, Cecilie von Spitzweig. His father was human (also considered the greatest swordsman in the Demon Kingdom; Dan Hiri Weller). His ancestor, Lawrence Weller, fought alongside the Original King during the war against Soushu. As Conrad's father was not a Mazoku noble, he doesn't have ""von"" in his name.

On his 16th birthday, he decided to live as a Mazoku instead of a human. He fought on the front lines for the Mazoku during a war against the humans. He and Yozak are the only two survivors of the Battle of Lütenburg, and at the request of Julia von Wincott, he was also put in charge of the soul that was to be the new Maoh. He transported it safely to Earth so that it could be born.

Furthermore, he was the one who was the inspiration for Yuuri's name. He stated that ""Where I come from, the month of July is called Yuuri"", which made Yuuri's mother name him 'Yuuri' because he was born in July. For this reason, Yuuri dubs him 'Nazukeoya', which is a person who names someone (Conrad is also known as Yuuri's Godfather by his mother). Cecilie named the blue flowers she grew ""Conrad Stands Upon Earth"".

When Yuuri first came to Shin Makoku, Conrad was the one to find him (after some humans and Adelbert) and bring him safely to the castle. He acts as Yuuri's bodyguard and vows to protect Yuri with his life. He was described by Yuri as almost perfect with fine looks and a mild demeanor but he makes the worst jokes. Typically, he could be found with an unassuming smile on his face, and persists in calling Yuuri 'Heika (Your Majesty)' except in dire situations, and when Yuuri scolds him for it.



He was also very close to Suzanna Julia von Wincott, whose soul now resides inside Yuuri.

A 24 year-old native of a village on the Shōryū River (near the northern Kōnan-Kutō border), he variously wields a shakujō staff, kasa hat, and kesa mantle to fight and employs various magical techniques taught by Taiitsukun, the first of which was the ability to form a barrier around himself. His true name is Houjun Ri (李 芳准, Ri Hōjun?), born under the star Well (井).

As the oldest and wisest of all of the Suzaku warriors, Chichiri thinks of himself as the older brother who looks after them all. Appearing superficially light-hearted, he can put on super deformed 'chibi' frivolity or suddenly be very serious and grim. While Tamahome and Hotohori are the obvious leaders, Chichiri is the ever-staunch adviser and supporter from behind the scenes, always willing to help when needed. Unconcerned with his own mortality or with earthly desires, he has a Zen master's detached attitude. He habitually ends many sentences with the emphatic phrase ""no da"", translated as ""ya know"" in the anime's English version (omitted in the English dub).

Aside from his incredible intelligence, Chiriko also employs a leaf flute against his opponents. He is thirteen years old. His true name is Doukon Ou (王 道煇, Ō Dōkon?), born the star Extended Net (張).

Chiriko's intelligence actually derives from his role as a Celestial Warrior and when his character disappears, he becomes a rather average child with limited intelligence. This limitation on his powers alongside being the youngest and physically weakest in the group is a source of frustration for Chiriko. He is particularly sensitive about his height and his peculiar intelligence and strives towards becoming a ""man of strength"", but is otherwise a quiet and good-natured student. Since a very young age, Chiriko has held a strong interest in research and has amassed a great deal of knowledge through books and study.

A passionate person at heart, she tends to see the world in black and white terms and is easily infuriated with perceived betrayal.

However, she becomes trapped in the book while trying to help Miaka return to the real world. Afterwards, bandits capture Yui and knock her unconscious. When she regains consciousness, she believes she has been raped and, distraught, attempts to kill herself. Nakago rescues her and convinces her that Miaka is responsible for Yui&amp;#039;s misfortunes, leaving Yui unaware that Nakago had saved her before the incident involving the bandits and that she had not been raped at all. He manipulates Yui into becoming the Priestess of Seiryū, convincing her that it will allow Yui to take revenge on Miaka.

He is soft-spoken and one of the most serious of the Suzaku Celestial Warriors. He is 22 years old and was born in Sōen Village, near Chōkō of northern part of Kōnan. His true name is Juan Myō (妙 寿安, Myou Juan?), born the star Chariot (軫). Mitsukake's fighting abilities are limited to his own strength, but as a Celestial Warrior, he possesses incredible healing powers at the cost of exchanging some of his own life force. He uses this ability frequently to heal minor injuries, but after healing life-threatening injuries, Mitsukake requires an entire day to regenerate his life force. His cat Tama is the unofficial mascot of the Suzaku Celestial Warriors and, after Mitsukake's death, becomes Chichiri's pet.

The son of a country doctor, he put his natural talents to work and often would help his father with his rounds. His father eventually died attempting to save villagers close to a flooding river during the same storm that claimed the lives of Chichiri's loved ones. Mitsukake shows utter devotion to healing; however after the death of Shōka, the daughter of the local nobleman who he was in love with, Mitsukake gave up medicine and dedicated all of his time and energy into finding a miracle herb that could cure any illness. It was during this reclusive stage that Miaka and the others find him, and managed to get him to join them with little persuasion. However, he continues to cherish the memory of the late Shōka.

Despite his expressionless appearance and tendency to remain silent, Mitsukake is a kind-hearted and calm man who seems aloof, but is actually shy and does not know how to be more outgoing. He is especially kind to the weak, elderly, the sickly, and children, as well as animals. During the battle between Konan and Kutō, he is severely wounded by Nakago. Mitsukake subsequently dies exhausting all his energy to save the life of a child who is later revealed to be the reincarnation of his beloved, as well as all the soldiers who had been wounded during the battle.

Born in Eiyou, the capital of Konan, Nuriko possesses superhuman strength and is later granted a pair of bracelets that transform into strength-increasing armbands by Taiitsukun. He is 18 years old. His true name is Ryuuen Chou, based on the star Willow.

While prone to jealousy, quick to anger, and possessing a calculating tendency, Nuriko is very level-headed and compassionate and shows the most concern regarding Miaka and Tamahome's relationship. As a ""woman,"" Nuriko is infatuated with his fellow warrior, Hotohori, but as a man, he also loves Miaka Yuuki. While initially jealous of Hotohori's love for Miaka, Nuriko and Miaka become close friends. After Nuriko comes to terms with the fact that his cross-dressing resulted from the unyielding pain of losing his sister Kourin, he concludes that he had been trying to live his life as Kourin would have, not as he would have. This revelation allows him to finally allow himself to experience life as a man. He cuts his hair, which once hung down to his waist in a braid, and admits to Tamahome that he loves Miaka as more than a friend. While he maintains his feelings for Hotohori, Nuriko eventually chooses to stop dressing as a woman in order to better protect Miaka.

Tamahome (鬼宿?), the first of the seven Celestial Warriors of Suzaku whom Miaka meets, comes into the story when he saves Miaka and Yui from slave-traders. Born in the country of Kounan (Hong-nan) Village of the Juusou (Shou-Shuang) as the eldest son of a large family, he is seventeen years old. His true name is Kishuku Sou (琮 鬼宿, Sō Kishuku?)  , based on the star Demon (鬼).

Tamahome appears the strongest member of the Suzaku warriors. An adept martial artist, proficient unarmed and with weapons, he proves a good street-fighter and can channel his ki into energy-blasts. When emotionally motivated, he is able to use his ki to increase his strength, speed, and reflexes in combat. Tamahome is also experienced in fencing thanks to being trained by Tokaki.

Initially, the story portrays Tamahome as a greedy young man, interested in helping others only if it means getting paid for it later. It is eventually revealed that his interest in accumulating money derives from trying to support his family. He comes across as cheerful, vain, and comic, but is actually shy and emotionally strong. Throughout the series, he demonstrates himself to be a sincere young man who is willing to sacrifice himself for the sake of others and unwilling to back down from enemies.

Extremely quick and agile, he particularly enjoys joking around with Nuriko, Tamahome, and Chichiri. He is 17 years old and was born in the town of Tai-Tou in the Ko prefecture, at the foot of Mount Reikaku. His true name is Shun&amp;#039;u Kou (侯 俊宇, Kō Shun&amp;#039;u?), born under the star Wings (翼). Tasuki&amp;#039;s primary weapon is a flame throwing Tessen, an iron fan used for fighting which is eventually upgraded to become a diamond fan that could only be used by Tasuki by Taitsukun. Additionally, he is skilled in judo, archery, swordsmanship, and is briefly capable of using ofuda. As a Celestial Warrior, he possesses superhuman speed and known as Genrou or Huang-Lang (幻狼|""Phantom Wolf"") because of his wolf-like appearance.

At a young age Tasuki found his calling as a bandit when Hakurō, the chief bandit of Mount Reikaku, took him under his wing. He began to improve his martial arts abilities in hopes of living up to and carrying on the role of his mentor[2]. He and fellow bandit Kōji eventually master the use of an iron fan in combat. Tasuki first meets Miaka when he kidnaps her in order to regain his rightful place as the leader of Mount Reikaku&amp;#039;s bandits. He eventually joins her in order to help the other Celestial Warriors on their quest, reluctantly leaving Kōji as the leader of the bandits of Mount Reikaku.

Straight-forward, simple-minded, and quick to pick a fight, Tasuki also has a strong sense of honour. Though he appears utterly blunt, vulgar, and loud, he is sentimental and easily emotional. He is a frequent source of comic relief in the series and enjoys joking around. Tasuki values his friends greatly and will not hesitate to kill those who would try to endanger them or make fun of them in any way. Despite being rough around the edges, Tasuki shares a particularly strong relationship with Chiriko. Tasuki, as the youngest child and only son of a family with five older sisters, an aggressive mother, and timid father, happily accepts the role of an older brother figure to Chiriko, who looks up to him and strives to become a ""manly man"" like Tasuki. Of all the Suzaku Celestial Warriors, he takes the deaths of his comrades the hardest and openly cries for them. A running joke in the series is that Tasuki is afraid to swim, claiming that it is because he is a ""man of the mountains"", though on several occasions he is able to instinctively tread water and finds unusual means of compensating for his weakness.

As the youngest and only son in a family with strong females and a weak father, Tasuki claims to hate women. But he demonstrates outstanding loyalty to Miaka and would die to protect her. His feelings toward her are apparently brotherly, but it is eventually revealed that he loves her. He acts on these feelings only once, when under a spell, but unwilling to betray his friends and aware of his behaviour, he attempts to kill himself, saved only when the spell is broken.

Miaka Yuuki (夕城 美朱), the primary protagonist in Fushigi Yûgi, an ordinary fifteen year old junior high school student, initially decides to become the Priestess of Suzaku  (Suzaku no Miko) in order to use one of the wishes she will receive when she summons Suzaku: she plans to enter the high school of her choice and be with her friend Yui.

Outgoing and optimistic, Miaka shows herself amiable with friends and strangers, and has a tendency to be guileless and sentimental. She is naïve, but sometimes surprises adults with an insightful comment. Miaka is generous and cares greatly for other people and perceives herself to be a considerate person. She can be unassuming and unsophisticated, but also magnanimous and courageous. Because she creates the impression of a person who always needs help, Miaka has the good fortune of almost always having someone looking after her.

Miaka has a primary weakness: her gluttony. She eats constantly and has an interest in any type of food. She is an avid fan of anime, imitating several characters during the course of the story.

A 24 year-old native of a village on the Shōryū River (near the northern Kōnan-Kutō border), he variously wields a shakujō staff, kasa hat, and kesa mantle to fight and employs various magical techniques taught by Taiitsukun, the first of which was the ability to form a barrier around himself. His true name is Houjun Ri (李 芳准, Ri Hōjun?), born under the star Well (井).

As the oldest and wisest of all of the Suzaku warriors, Chichiri thinks of himself as the older brother who looks after them all. Appearing superficially light-hearted, he can put on super deformed 'chibi' frivolity or suddenly be very serious and grim. While Tamahome and Hotohori are the obvious leaders, Chichiri is the ever-staunch adviser and supporter from behind the scenes, always willing to help when needed. Unconcerned with his own mortality or with earthly desires, he has a Zen master's detached attitude. He habitually ends many sentences with the emphatic phrase ""no da"", translated as ""ya know"" in the anime's English version (omitted in the English dub).

His true name is Doukon Ou (王 道煇, Ō Dōkon?), born the star Extended Net (張).

Chiriko's intelligence actually derives from his role as a Celestial Warrior and when his character disappears, he becomes a rather average child with limited intelligence. This limitation on his powers alongside being the youngest and physically weakest in the group is a source of frustration for Chiriko. He is particularly sensitive about his height and his peculiar intelligence and strives towards becoming a ""man of strength"", but is otherwise a quiet and good-natured student. Since a very young age, Chiriko has held a strong interest in research and has amassed a great deal of knowledge through books and study.

His true name is Juan Myō (妙 寿安, Myou Juan?), born the star Chariot (軫). Mitsukake's fighting abilities are limited to his own strength, but as a Celestial Warrior, he possesses incredible healing powers at the cost of exchanging some of his own life force. He uses this ability frequently to heal minor injuries, but after healing life-threatening injuries, Mitsukake requires an entire day to regenerate his life force. His cat Tama is the unofficial mascot of the Suzaku Celestial Warriors and, after Mitsukake's death, becomes Chichiri's pet.

The son of a country doctor, he put his natural talents to work and often would help his father with his rounds. His father eventually died attempting to save villagers close to a flooding river during the same storm that claimed the lives of Chichiri's loved ones. Mitsukake shows utter devotion to healing; however after the death of Shōka, the daughter of the local nobleman who he was in love with, Mitsukake gave up medicine and dedicated all of his time and energy into finding a miracle herb that could cure any illness. It was during this reclusive stage that Miaka and the others find him, and managed to get him to join them with little persuasion. However, he continues to cherish the memory of the late Shōka.

Despite his expressionless appearance and tendency to remain silent, Mitsukake is a kind-hearted and calm man who seems aloof, but is actually shy and does not know how to be more outgoing. He is especially kind to the weak, elderly, the sickly, and children, as well as animals. During the battle between Konan and Kutō, he is severely wounded by Nakago. Mitsukake subsequently dies exhausting all his energy to save the life of a child who is later revealed to be the reincarnation of his beloved, as well as all the soldiers who had been wounded during the battle.

This revelation allows him to finally allow himself to experience life as a man. He cuts his hair, which once hung down to his waist in a braid, and admits to Tamahome that he loves Miaka as more than a friend. While he maintains his feelings for Hotohori, Nuriko eventually chooses to stop dressing as a woman in order to better protect Miaka.

Tamahome (鬼宿?), the first of the seven Celestial Warriors of Suzaku whom Miaka meets, comes into the story when he saves Miaka and Yui from slave-traders. Born in the country of Kounan (Hong-nan) Village of the Juusou (Shou-Shuang) as the eldest son of a large family, he is seventeen years old. His true name is Kishuku Sou (琮 鬼宿, Sō Kishuku?)  , based on the star Demon (鬼).

Tamahome appears the strongest member of the Suzaku warriors. An adept martial artist, proficient unarmed and with weapons, he proves a good street-fighter and can channel his ki into energy-blasts. When emotionally motivated, he is able to use his ki to increase his strength, speed, and reflexes in combat. Tamahome is also experienced in fencing thanks to being trained by Tokaki.

Initially, the story portrays Tamahome as a greedy young man, interested in helping others only if it means getting paid for it later. It is eventually revealed that his interest in accumulating money derives from trying to support his family. He comes across as cheerful, vain, and comic, but is actually shy and emotionally strong. Throughout the series, he demonstrates himself to be a sincere young man who is willing to sacrifice himself for the sake of others and unwilling to back down from enemies.

Extremely quick and agile, he particularly enjoys joking around with Nuriko, Tamahome, and Chichiri. He is 17 years old and was born in the town of Tai-Tou in the Ko prefecture, at the foot of Mount Reikaku. His true name is Shun&amp;#039;u Kou (侯 俊宇, Kō Shun&amp;#039;u?), born under the star Wings (翼). Tasuki&amp;#039;s primary weapon is a flame throwing Tessen, an iron fan used for fighting which is eventually upgraded to become a diamond fan that could only be used by Tasuki by Taitsukun. Additionally, he is skilled in judo, archery, swordsmanship, and is briefly capable of using ofuda. As a Celestial Warrior, he possesses superhuman speed and known as Genrou or Huang-Lang (幻狼|""Phantom Wolf"") because of his wolf-like appearance.

At a young age Tasuki found his calling as a bandit when Hakurō, the chief bandit of Mount Reikaku, took him under his wing. He began to improve his martial arts abilities in hopes of living up to and carrying on the role of his mentor[2]. He and fellow bandit Kōji eventually master the use of an iron fan in combat. Tasuki first meets Miaka when he kidnaps her in order to regain his rightful place as the leader of Mount Reikaku&amp;#039;s bandits. He eventually joins her in order to help the other Celestial Warriors on their quest, reluctantly leaving Kōji as the leader of the bandits of Mount Reikaku.

Straight-forward, simple-minded, and quick to pick a fight, Tasuki also has a strong sense of honour. Though he appears utterly blunt, vulgar, and loud, he is sentimental and easily emotional. He is a frequent source of comic relief in the series and enjoys joking around. Tasuki values his friends greatly and will not hesitate to kill those who would try to endanger them or make fun of them in any way. Despite being rough around the edges, Tasuki shares a particularly strong relationship with Chiriko. Tasuki, as the youngest child and only son of a family with five older sisters, an aggressive mother, and timid father, happily accepts the role of an older brother figure to Chiriko, who looks up to him and strives to become a ""manly man"" like Tasuki. Of all the Suzaku Celestial Warriors, he takes the deaths of his comrades the hardest and openly cries for them. A running joke in the series is that Tasuki is afraid to swim, claiming that it is because he is a ""man of the mountains"", though on several occasions he is able to instinctively tread water and finds unusual means of compensating for his weakness.

As the youngest and only son in a family with strong females and a weak father, Tasuki claims to hate women. But he demonstrates outstanding loyalty to Miaka and would die to protect her. His feelings toward her are apparently brotherly, but it is eventually revealed that he loves her. He acts on these feelings only once, when under a spell, but unwilling to betray his friends and aware of his behaviour, he attempts to kill himself, saved only when the spell is broken.

Sign: Aries

Prince of Fanelia, pilot of Escaflowne, Van Fanel suddenly appears on Earth one day, fighting a Dragon. His life narrowly saved by Hitomi, a schoolgirl caught up in the battle, Van returns to his kingdom only for it to be torched to the ground a few days later. Van vows revenge on the perpetrators—the Zaibach Empire—even when he finds that Folken, his supposedly dead elder-brother, is working for them. With Hitomi's help, Van hones his fighting abilities and begins to predict his opponent's moves, giving him the upper hand: he is however, deeply effected by his blood-pact with Escaflowne, which requires that he shares the bodily damage it suffers in battle. 


Van Fanel is the young half-Draconian king of Fanelia who must learn to cope with drastic changes in his life after Fanelia is destroyed by Zaibach. He pilots Escaflowne, a Guymelef made by the mysterious Ispano tribe which can transform into a flying dragon. He earns his right to pilot Escaflowne through a blood pact which connects his body and soul to Escaflowne. Due to the blood pact and Hitomi's influence, Van becomes injured when the Escaflowne is damaged, and these wounds will not close until Escaflowne is repaired. Consequently, if Escaflowne is destroyed, Van will die.

His destiny and Hitomi's are linked, and he is initially dependent on Hitomi's clairvoyant abilities, which save his life more than once. He also holds a grudge against Folken for leaving his native kingdom of Fanelia for Zaibach and Dornkirk for his grand ambitions. Due to being half-Draconian, Van is able to manifest a pair of feathered wings which enable him to fly.

Folken abandoned Fanelia after being sent out to retrieve a drag-energist as his right of passage to becoming king. He joined forces with Emperor Dornkirk and the Zaibach Empire in hopes of ending war (through war, ironically). He is torn between his roles as commander and brother, a conflict which is resolved by the end of the series.

(The Strategos or tactician of Zaibach, Folken is revealed to be Van's older brother and the original heir to Fanelia. After he failed to kill a dragon, he lost an arm to the beast and was later picked up by the Zaibach, who nursed him back to health under Dornkirk's instructions and fitted him with a mechanical arm. He originally joined the empire in hopes of realizing Zaibach's ideals of a world free of war...)

For all that for the first few episodes of the series Folken seems like a rather heartless, robotic devote of Zaibach's regime, he reveals himself to be a profoundly brilliant and compassionate man. He is an engineer, a sorcerer, a chemist, and a strategist of a caliber paralleled only by Dornkirk himself. He is a true archetypal tragic villain; he truly does think that what he is doing is for the greater good. Ultimately, his desires go far beyond merely wanting to eliminate war—he wants to re-create the very laws of ""fate"" governing a world he sees as otherwise doomed to seep itself in needless tragedy.

Though egotistical, cynical, and downright cocky, he is deeply selfless and romantic. He is social and likes to talk with anybody on just about anything intellectual. He is quite possibly the most laid back character in the entire cast, and one of the precious few with a good sense of humor. He has a knack for irritating just about anybody with reserves or reverence for anything arbitrary, whether it be propriety, society, or the proper role of a father. Needless to say, he manages to nettle almost every single member of the cast at least once, some multiple times. His idea of flirting is flat-out advertising his assets (i.e. more or less ""My intellect is second-to-none, I'm freaking rich, and I'm good-looking.""), if that gives a good idea of how brash he can be, but in his (very) few serious moments his courting methods turn to solemn vows. He takes a passionate interest in esoteric and arcane topics of study, such as Atlantis and Guymelefs, the latter of which he collects not for their military force, but for their integrity of construction. Not only is he a first-class nerd, but he is a first-class nerd with heaps of style. He is a noble-born rich boy, but he dresses as though he just stumbled out of bed, ties his hair back messily, and wears the coolest glasses I have ever seen, period. He is somebody who can make you laugh and who can still laugh at himself and life, no matter how desolate things may seem or how many people he will piss off.

Dryden is the son of a jerk of an Astorian noble, Meiden Fassa, and runs his own lucrative merchant airship convoy. His father arranged for him to marry the princess of Astoria, Millerna Aston, a headstrong and intelligent woman with whom he fell in love and spent a great deal of the show trying to win, unsuccessfully. After their rather eventful wedding day and after realizing that she was still in love with Allen Schezar, he allowed Millerna to leave, no strings attached, with the promise that he would become a man worthy of her love. The question of whether or not Dryden ends up winning Millerna is unanswered by the end of the show. Dryden becomes king of Astoria after their marriage, which is fortunate considering that at the end of the war a far more competent king than Aston is in the throne. He is willing to negotiate with and listen to Folken after he leaves Zaibach, and he displays pacifist tendencies; the core of his strategic response to the Zaibach threat is economic sanctions. In the first scene in which he appears, he is allowing his pet mermaid, Sylvie, to go free after a goodbye kiss, despite his manager's protests regarding her monetary cost, to which Dryden replies ""Don't be so frugal."" He sold his entire merchant convoy to the Ispano to pay for Escaflowne's repair job and, in effect, Van's life, much to the distress of the manager who keeps flitting around and freaking out every time Dryden does something so liberal. Dryden was the narrator of Leon Schezar's diary as the party searched for Atlantis, and in the process managed to get on Allen's bad side. No surprise. Dryden is the manifestation of Allen's petty annoyances: disorder, casualty, and irreverence.

The voice of reason. She is also highly intelligent, though this goes more for book smarts than street smarts. She often has moments where she doubts herself, but ends up coming out strong in the end. She is also in love with Ferio. She is the Magic Knight of Wind.

Umi Ryuuzaki is the Magic Knight of Water. Despite being a beautiful and elegant girl, with a tall model-like figure and long, flowing blue hair, she actually has a short temper, and was initially shown to be the most skeptical of the three. Later on, however, between the three Magic Knights, she took on the mantle of the Big Sister and proved to be very protective of her two best friends, Fuu Hououji and Hikaru Shidou.

Hikaru is one of the three Magic Knights summoned to Cephiro by Princess Emeraude; the knight of fire (as her names implies. Hikaru means ""Light of the Lion Shrine"").

She is the smallest of the three knights, often mistaken for an elementary student and considered a bit tomboyish by her classmates. Despite her height, and her apparent naïveté, she can be quite fierce and strong when the needs calls for it. Underneath her ever-present smiles and innocence, there lies a the spirit of a warrior who is determined to protect her friends and everyone's happiness. Even at the cost of her own.

Because of this, as the series evolves, she is the one who is most affected—physically and mentally—by all the brutality and war around her. Nonetheless, Hikaru keeps a strong facade, trying not to worry Umi and Fuu who she considers her most precious friends, despite only having met them moments before being dragged into Cephiro.

As the true reasons for their summon come to light, and Hikaru is forced to act with Umi and Fuu to kill both Zagato and a grief-stricken Emeraude, her heart overflows with pain and self-hate and she unwittingly burns a shadow—Nova—across the surface of Cephiro before being transported back to Earth.

During the second season, she is forced to battle her other self-Nova is vengeful and maliciously possessive of her, causing more heartache and troubles—and her own blooming feelings for Kail Lantis.

At first, Hikaru approaches him, feeling guilty for the death of his brother, and begs him to hate only her, to hit only her but not to hurt Umi or Fuu. The moment Lantis tells her that she shouldn't blame herself, as it wasn't her fault but destiny, is most likely the moment when she starts falling for him. Without knowing it.

Throughout the entire second season, she and Lantis are brought together many times, by circumstances, and it is not until Nova points out that she is very much in love with Lantis that Hikaru realizes it herself.

After a grueling battle, in her own mind, to reforge the sword that Nova managed to break, Hikaru comes out victorious and, on the verge of blacking out in Lantis's arms, confesses to him that she loves him. She does not remember it after she wakes up but the feelings are still alive in her heart and Nova takes advantage of them time and time again.

Despite the animosity between Cephiro and the three invading countries, she manages to befriend Eagle Vision of Autozam, making Eagle a sort of bridge between both his friends.

At one point in the anime, Eagle and Hikaru both become candidates for the Pillar position but it is Hikaru who is chosen in the end and makes a wish to rid Cephiro of its oppressive system; wishing for Cephiro to be created by all those who love it.

In the manga, Hikaru's feeling for Lantis is less mature and she likes both Lantis and Eagle Vision. When Lantis asked her in final chapter who she wants to marry, she answered, that she wants to marry him and Eagle. Also bond between Hikaru and Eagle Vision is stronger in manga, because in manga she fought with him for the position of the Pillar, defeated him and then saved his life against the will of the Creator.

However, she fell in love with the high priest, Zagato, and for this love became his servant, although the affection is entirely one-sided. In the manga, she is killed after failing Zagato not once but twice. In the anime, she lives on until near the end of the second series; few after Zagato and Esmeraude's deaths, she's captured by the evil witch Debonair, who brainwashes her into becoming her slave. Lantis captures Alcyone in battle, but she has lost her memories; when she recovers them, she reveals Debonair's plans for Cephiro and Debonair's location, but her former mistress kills her before she can finish.

In the Sega Saturn game, Alcyone appears to die, then comes back near the end of the game in the later part of Zagato's palace.

Her name is occasionally misromanized as ""Alcione""--this was featured in the first run of the English-language manga. Her name comes from the Subaru Alcyone SVX. In the Spanish version of the anime, she is called Alanis.

Although hideous, they have no ill will, but villagers still fear them. Thus, Ascot was driven away until Zagato offered to give him and his friends a home in exchange for serving under him. In the anime, he destroys Presea's house with his monsters, and essentially causes her death; later, he confronts the Knights again (their first encounter in the manga), but Umi slaps him for using his friends and causing them pain. This causes a change of heart in Ascot, and he then forsakes Zagato. In the second series, he has used the power of his own will to make himself into an adult because of his love for Umi. Also, he still summons monsters but has learned other spells from Clef to avoid using his friends as living weapons.

In the anime he is able to tell Umi his feelings before she leaves to fight Tarta. Umi replies that she loves him as well, but just as much as everyone else in Cephiro, and that she didn't have any romantic feelings for him. This saddens Ascot a bit, but he still tries to win her heart later on.

A tough young man wielding a sword taller than he is, he quickly develops a soft spot for Fuu, which by the second season has evolved into love. Never completely honest with others, he made himself difficult for our heroines to trust. 

In the anime he gives Fuu a jewelled orb (in the manga series, he gives her a ring identical to the one on his ear. Fuu loses it when the three go home to Tokyo in the first series, but in the second series, when they return, he gives it to her for a second time.) Since he has one identical to it, he uses it to communicate with her throughout the first series. 

In the anime's first season, Ferio once pretended to join Ascot, Lord Zagato's child summoner, who set a trap for the Magic Knights using his sound-sensitive monster, Pajero. Also, while the Magic Knights are facing Inouva's true form, Ferio regains his memory from his younger years. He realizes that he was Princess Emeraude's only younger brother, and hears his sister's voice coming from his own orb, telling him how to defeat Inouva. Ferio relays the info to the Knights and they manage to kill their enemy. 

In the OVA, he is initially a villain who can summon and control swarms of insects. He appears to have a close relationship with Ascot, and in a twist of his original character, he is the villain who does battle with Fuu. After eavesdropping on Lantis' conversation with Hikaru and the others, he assists Lantis in fighting Cephiro's spirits, and later delivers Lantis' sword to the combined Mashin to help them fight Eagle. 

Ferio gets his name from the Honda Civic Ferio, and Ascot's monster from the episode featuring Ferio is named after the Mitsubishi Pajero.

Koushirou is a computer expert and spends most of his free time researching on his laptop (which resembles a Tangerine Apple iBook, only with a pineapple symbol). He is very curious and is always making theories and trying to understand the world around him. He starts out as a very introverted person, who isn't very in touch with other people and doesn't really understand their feelings. Being logical and thoughtful, he doesn't appreciate impulsiveness and gets angry when people around him act before thinking. He used to be on the soccer team with Sora and Taichi, though this was only to avoid contact with people as he isn't very good at playing soccer. He is the partner of Tentomon and the bearer of the Crest of Knowledge.

He was adopted by Izumi Masami, a distant relative of his father's and his wife Yoshie, who had suffered the loss of their own baby boy not long before the accident. Koushirou was unaware for most of his life, and once he found out, he was devastated.

She later digivolved to Togemon when the Black-Gear-infected Monzaemon attacked them in Toy Town. Since then, she and Mimi have been good friends but Palmon often tries to make Mimi appreciate what she has. When the DigiDestined returned to the Real World to halt the plans of Myotismon, she digivolved to Lillymon when Mimi shed sincere tears for the well-being of her father when he tried to trip DarkTyrannomon in vain. Because of this new-found power, Lillymon became a needed ally in the battles against Myotismon, the Dark Masters and Apocalymon. After Piedmon and Apocalymon were defeated, the kids had to leave the Digital World. Palmon ran away into the forest, not wanting to see Mimi again - because if she did, she would have to say goodbye. As the trolley the kids were leaving in moved off, Palmon ran out of the woods, calling to Mimi, apologizing and waving goodbye.

One year after their adventure, Mimi and Palmon were reunited. Mimi gave up her Crest's power to free the Sovereigns. As a result, Palmon lost the power to become Lillymon. Two years later, when the Digimon Emperor was conquering the Digital World, Palmon was amongst the old generation Digimon to help the new DigiDestined. One such event was when Yolei, Hawkmon and Mimi were lost and chased by a Dark Ringed group of Gekomon and Otamamon in the Night Forest, with Palmon saving them. She and Mimi introduced the new DigiDestined to American DigiDestined Michael and his partner, Betamon, too. It was also Palmon who revealed that the strange Digimon attacking for no reason were artificial beings created from Control Spires. She also came to the Real World on Christmas Eve and on Christmas Day she helped to gather the other Digimon who had appeared in America along with the Control Spires, receiving a power boost from one of the DigiCores of Azulongmon, restoring her ability to Digivolve to Ultimate. She was later seen sealing the Hikarigaoka Gate and in the final battle against MaloMyotismon.

Attacks:
Poison Ivy: Entangles the opponent in her vine-like claws. 

Palmon can evolve into Togemon (Champion) or Ponchomon (Champion), Lillymon/Lilimon (Ultimate) and Rosemon (Mega).",Main,"Yamada, Kinoko, Garduno, Anna, Vulcano, Monica, Baronne, Fernanda, Roux, Annabelle, Schramm, Gabriele, Guerrero, Marco","Japanese, English, Italian, Portuguese (BR), French, German, Spanish","https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/11132.jpg?s=894b370ba6461dda184d359f640f919e, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/questionmark_23.gif?s=f7dcbc4a4603d18356d3dfef8abd655c, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/38195.jpg?s=b48945ed3aacad9357a5acab96decc5c, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/76270.jpg?s=923fdb65b012210f5b77df8b776a5c26, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/67163.jpg?s=d0046b55d6f56ba5a5e4da4d5abf4db4, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/47692.jpg?s=56c75b9a17b5d552e7693eaa753e98e6, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/72237.jpg?s=78e5602fc7657295e2ea1a90f02a80f3"

This mammal digimon has also been considered to look like a mouse or pig with wings.

Patamon is a main character in Digimon Adventure and Digimon Adventure 02, as well as the movies Digimon Adventure (The movie), Our War Game!, The Golden Digimentals and Diaboromon Strikes Back. Patamon also appears as a supporting character in Digimon Frontier.

Patamon is the playful Digimon partner of Takeru. In Digimon Adventure, Patamon was the last of the Digi-Destined Digimon to achieve his Champion form, and the last again to achieve his Ultimate form. However, both his Champion and Ultimate forms are immensely powerful for their respective level, and are responsible for defeating Devimon and the final Dark Master, Piedmon respectively.

Takeru returns as a main character in the second Digimon Adventure 02 season, as does Patamon. Because of the Digimon Emperor's control spires, Patamon was no longer able to Digivolve into his Champion form, and instead fought in his Armor form when he uses the Digi-Egg of Hope - Pegasusmon. In the 2020 series, Patamon can Digivolve to Pegasusmon without the Digi-Egg of Hope.

In the series, Patamon has a childish and sensitive personality.

Attacks:

Boom Bubble (Air Shot): Patamon's body inflates as he gulps in air - which he then shoots forward from his mouth.

Slamming Attack (Body Slam): Patamon charges at his enemy attempting to knock them out (This attack is very rarely used).

Birthday: 1989

Mimi is kind and caring - although initially slightly selfish and self-centered - and obsessed with her outer appearance. Deep down inside, she's a very sweet girl. She's used to royal treatment so living in the Digital World isn't exactly her cup of tea. Her Digimon partner, Palmon, tries to help her understand that outer appearances aren't everything. Mimi possesses the Crest of Purity.

In 02, Mimi spends a lot of time in America. She returns with her hair dyed her favorite color (pink) and a new wardrobe. She still acts like a princess but has matured enough to know that there are more important things in life.

1466,647,"Abe no, Yasuaki",安倍泰明,,https://myanimelist.net/character/1466/Yasuaki_Abe_no,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/5/99306.jpg?s=038988498a2b36b8c059103b3a15d6d2,54.0,"One of the Hachiyō, he is the Genbu of Earth. Yasuaki is an Onmyōji, and the successor to the famous, historical Onmyōji Abe no Seimei.

Unlike his fellow Hachiyou, Yasuaki was not ""born"" a human, but created through Abe no Seimei's magical skill, and crafted into his current form through that same ability (in the manga he even talks about Seimei using a Tengu's power to help form him, although this is not explained in the anime). For this reason, despite having the physical appearance of a twenty one year old adult male, Yasuaki has only actually been alive for two years. This in many ways explains his emotional simplicity and naivety, since he has not yet learnt many of the things his companions have grown up absorbing.

For the most part, Yasuaki is a composed, detached individual that operates largely on logic and is sometimes perceived as cold or strange. When it appears that Eisen will die if he exorcises the eight-stringed Kin, Yasuaki states the fact bluntly and without any concern because he sees it simply in black and white - to save the Miko, a Hachiyou must be prepared to do his duty. As he puts it - ""If there is no Miko, there is no point in the Hachiyou."" 

When Yasuaki was ""born"", Seimei told him he had been born to find someone important to him, and that he lacked something as a person - a heart - which could not be crafted. For this reason, Yasuaki has accepted his master's words as meaning he's not a ""real person"", and therefore does not count in the same way as his Hachiyou companions. He believes he is the Miko's ""tool"" - in the manga, he is worried that he is ""broken"" because he can no longer read Akane's heart (although Akane explains to him that that just makes him like every other person, and that he's not broken at all)

In the anime he tells her that ""a tool that no longer works has no option but to be destroyed"" after Shirin tells him that he will never be able to find the Northern Seal. In the anime, his ignorance of human feelings make him tell Ran the memories that to that point had been concealed from her, driving her back to the Oni clan and causing a lot of trouble for the Hachiyou. In the manga, it is when he releases Kotengu's seal and sends him into battle against Ikutidaru, only to have the creature apparently slain at the demon's hands.

Yasuaki has many odd habits during the anime and the manga - including talking to trees, possessing small animals to convey messages and even casting spell dolls to help him do the cleaning. Although undoubtedly the most powerful of the Hachiyou at the start, he is also probably the most vulnerable on account of his background and his origins.

Yasuaki's developmental stages and childlike naivety are more clearly outlined in the manga, also - at one point, he asks why people tell lies, but later winds up lying to Akane himself to protect her from the grief of Kotengu's apparent passing away. This act tortures him for some time afterwards and he withdraws from Akane's company completely, convinced she must be angry with him for telling her a lie.

Yasuaki's most commonly said phrase in the manga and the anime is (mondai nai - no problem), a catchphrase which was even picked up on and exploited in one of the live Haruka Matsuri festas. He also often says (wakaranai - I don't understand) - usually when relating to some human nuance that he hasn't managed to grasp yet.",Main,"Ishida, Akira, Byeon, Hyeon Wu, Käser, Daniel","Japanese, Korean, German","https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/62624.jpg?s=e177139a222a21c2cd73e39e54187aef, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/15975.jpg?s=ad2cc174826bc5b6a6dd3f7782f3aaff, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/31951.jpg?s=4cd0f175322ea7ba16d8a4f2309e4d59"

It rides on the gigantic motorcycle-type machine Behemoth, holding its cherished shotguns the Berenjena. Although its personality is cruel and merciless, it is also exceedingly prideful, so it would never attack the weak.

This infuriated Takato, who forced Megalo Growmon to evolve into Megidramon to kill Beelzebumon, but he went on a rampage and eventually reverted to Guilmon. Following that, Takato and Guilmon Matrix Evolved together into Dukemon, who nearly killed Beelzebumon. However, Beelzebumon was spared by Juri. By the time Beelzebumon appeared again, he was determined to repent for his sins, and evolved further into Blast Mode.

He was created from Takato's imagination and brought to life by the Blue Card. At first, Guilmon had not been aware of the differences between humans and Digimon, calling his partner Tamer ""Takatomon"".

Guilmon is normally playful and friendly, proving to be quite popular with Takato's classmates for being a real live Digimon. Despite being portrayed as childlike, Guilmon does at times show deep insight. For example, when Takato didn't want Guilmon to digivolve, in fear that Guilmon would no longer be the same, Guilmon pointed out that Takato has changed over time as well, but he is still the same person.

Guilmon had one of the deepest realtionships with his tamer out of the whole series, the two did many things together and conquering many hurdles. Guilmon is very loyal and protective of Takato and would do anything for him. When Guilmon dark-digivolved into Megidramon it was because of their deep bond that Takato managed to come to his senses which allowed him to rescue Guilmon and bring him back, later allowing them to biomerge to Gallantmon to fight Beezlemon.

The war between the Earth Defense Force and the Rara Army began when D and at least two mechas were discovered in an artifact of unknown origin. Her original body was damaged, so a bioroid was built to contain her essence (represented by a glowing orb in place of an eye) while her body healed.

D appears to be as inhuman as the robot she pilots, speaking mechanically and asking many questions about human emotions and behavior. The only one to break through her stony exterior is Kazuki, to the shock of Commander Sanada. D frequently has visions of a horrible creature attacking, and is deathly afraid of Himiko.

She develops a strong attachment to Kazuki, culminating in her decision to return to her real body at the climax of the series in order to save him. It's revealed that D stole Zinv and fled her world to escape Himiko and Kumu, who claimed the lives of her friends.

As a robot pilot, D is subpar, often requiring rescue by Kazuki and Mitsuki. However, she redeems herself by removing the limiter placed upon Zinv, allowing its true power to manifest itself.

When Zinv is destroyed and the worlds merge, D becomes Dee Sanada, taking on the animated personality of a young girl.

There is also an apparent resemblance between D and Tenchi Muyo! GXP character Neju na Melmas, leading some to believe that she and D may belong to the same race.

A Digimon that possesses power over Flame which bears the might of one of the legendary Warrior Ten. Because its ""Digicore"" is wrapped in the Spiritual Fire which is called a holy blaze, it is able to freely manipulate flames. 

It is an incarnation of the ""Firewall"" that defends the Net, and is also a guardian deity. Because of its easily fired-up personality, it has a soldier-like aspect that practices mental training with yoga exercises, and its way of speaking is somewhat archaic, like a kenpo artist. 

In battle, it fights by freely using Oriental martial arts, and accumulates flames at one point of its body with a trick that focuses its spirit, to raise its offensive ability.

A Digimon that possesses power over Thunder which bears the might of one of the legendary Ten Warriors. Its keen movements, unbecoming of its large build, are a technique to form a high voltage current running throughout its body. 

It generates a special magnetic field that produces an anti-gravity state in its vicinity, and is capable of high-speed movement. Its overflowing thunder power comes out as sparks from various parts of its body, and although Blitzmon looks mechanical, its personality is, in contrast, expressive and human. 

Its language is trollish, but it additionally conveys excess warmth. In battle, its underwater mobility is weak due to the nature of its wrestler-like style.

A Digimon that possesses power over Ice which bears the might of one of the legendary Ten Warriors. It styles itself as holding rank as a member of a polar army's polar region defense force. 

Since it replies that the matter's top secret if you ask anything about it, the truth is unknown. It's thought to be largely something it dreamed up. However, its operation of the Launcher it carries (nicknamed Romeo) and its precision conduct in battle are genuine, and its survivalist knowledge also has a strong, truly reliable existence. 

Since it rarely acts of its own volition, it primarily operates in response to someone's requests or orders. It will have nothing to do if nobody is relying on it, and is likely to worry about its purpose in life and get completely depressed. The shots fired from its Launcher are special snowballs, so there are several varieties according to purpose.

In this series, a group of chosen human children were given the ability to turn into Digimon.

Tomoki is always genuine in his feelings and looks up to Takuya Kanbara as his hero. As the series progresses, Tomoki learns to stand up for himself, even fighting his own battles. He learns to become more brave and self-reliant over the course of the series. Unlike the others Tomoki only ever defeated a foe on his own once to the point of destruction. He purified the Chamelemon and defeated them, but they reverted to Armadilomon. The only evil Digimon he ever killed was Asuramon when he was in Sakkakumon's Fire Sphere. It was also the only time he ever battled by himself.

In this series, a group of chosen human children are given the ability to turn into Digimon. Takuya is the leader of this group, and is given the ""Spirits of Flame"" at the beginning of the series. He is in the fifth grade (sixth grade in the dubbed version).

Takuya's story starts when he receives a mysterious SMS message on his mobile phone one afternoon, on his brother's birthday, conviently. The message instructs him to go to a subway station, where a Trailmon took him and four other human children into the Digital World.

Takuya begins the series as a typical ""goggle boy"", (only he wears a hat underneath his gray and square goggles)—energetic and athletic, but tending to act without thinking and very stubborn. He has a strong sense of justice, and tries to use his power to do what he believes is right. His hot-headed personality often leads to him arguing with Koji Minamoto, another of Digimon Frontier's main characters. However, they learn to respect each other toward the middle of the series, after their first encounter with Duskmon, and become good friends and partners in battle. He acts like an older brother to Tommy Himi, who reminds him of his real brother Shinya.

Takuya also makes an appearance in a special chapter of the Digimon manga V-Tamer 01, where he teams up with Tai to fight Metamormon.

Koichi is the final member to join the team. He was chosen to wield the Spirits of Darkness that hold AncientSphinxmon's power.

He is Koji Minamoto's twin brother. Their parents divorced when they were very young, so they hardly knew about each other. Koichi learned about Koji when his grandmother told him on her deathbed. He ran after Koji, who was on his way to the Digital World, to try and catch up with him but he fell down a flight of stairs and ended up in a coma as a result. His mind was taken into the Digital World by Cherubimon, who saw his sadness. He erased Koichi's memories and gave him the Human Spirit of Darkness to give him a semi-physical form as Duskmon until he was freed from Cherubimon's control by Aldamon and Beowolfmon. After this, he wielded the purified Spirits of Darkness and fought alongside his brother and the other DigiDestined.

Later on, Koichi began to realize that, in reality, his mind was not truly in the Digital World. On multiple occasions, the DigiDestined were seriously injured, revealing their Fractal Code (Digi-Code in Japan). However, each time Koichi is far less hurt and reveals no Fractal Code. Crusadermon informed him that he was only a ghost within the Digital World and this troubled him towards the end of the series. As the final battles with Lucemon ensued, Koichi sacrificed himself to save the other DigiDestined, giving his spirits of darkness to his brother, Koji. The powers of light and darkness begin to react within Koji's body, helping trigger Koji and Takuya's final evolution into Susanoomon. In the final episode it is revealed by Löwemon that Koichi is still alive but is badly hurt. As Koji burst into the emergency room, he realized he was too late to save his brother. But in the end, the other DigiDestineds' D-Tector Digivices were able to revive him after his death just moments earlier.

Koji receives Ophanimon's cell phone message while he was out buying flowers for his stepmother. He followed the instructions on the SMS, which led to a subway station where a Trailmon took him to the Digital World.

Koji travelled alone until he met Tommy and J.P. and had to save the two from a horde of attacking Pagumon. From then on, Koji showed up to help the other Digi Destined from time to time, and then eventually joins the group permanently. He often distances himself from the others, refusing to let anyone get too close to him. This was revealed to be because he moved a lot, and believes that no matter how close two people can get, something pulls them apart, so he stops trying to make friends and be, as he puts it, 'better prepared for it.' Originally, he is rather cold and rude towards the other DigiDestined, but eventually softens up as he becomes closer to them.

In this series, a group of chosen human children were given the ability to turn into Digimon. 

J.P. is the oldest member of the group, and was the one who was chosen to wield the ""Spirits of Thunder"". This allows J.P. to use AncientBeetlemon's power to turn into two Digimon forms which use mainly electricity attacks. 

At the start of the series, J.P. shows some jealousy towards Takuya Kanbara, the main character of this series for being Tommy Himi's hero and being able to combine both of his Digimon forms into a more powerful form. He also shows feelings for Zoe Orimoto, the only female of the group. J.P. also seems to have a hidden fear of being alone - despite being constantly surrounded by people when he was in the real world, he felt that he had never really been anyone's real friend. 

This fear spawned some rather obnoxious behaviour in the earlier parts of the series. As the series progresses, J.P. learns to confront his fears, and begins to see the other members of the group as real friends. He also overcomes the jealousy he feels towards Takuya. 

He's the first one to kill one of the evil Legendary Warriors: after Grumblemon lost his Beast Spirit to Takuya as BurningGreymon, Grumblemon ambushes the Digidestined with a bunch of Golemon. After Whamon saves him from Grumblemon's attack, J.P. finally gets his Beast Spirit which was in Whamon's stomach and evolves into an out of control MetalKabuterimon. He gains control over himself quickly and shoots Grumblemon, killing him, allowing J.P. to take his Human Spirit and give Zoe back hers.

After that she becomes extremely protective of Mill, who often shows intimate feelings or sexual advances toward Maze. She is a natural pacifist when the story begins. She has considerable magical ability but initially is much less effective at using them while a female. Maze is a fusion of Mei and her brother Akira who switch places at daybreak and nightfall.

At night Maze turns into a male with a distinct personality from the daytime female form. He loves to fight, to the horror of the female form, who can be seen trapped in his head shouting at him wherever he tries to fight. In male form he has vastly increased magical powers. He is very sexually predatory towards almost any pretty girl he meets. Like the female Maze, his memories are mostly wiped or jumbled upon leaving the real world, though they start to recover over time. He is initially portrayed as a sex crazed, violent monster with little personality, but in time his personality emerges.The Japanese character for ""Akira"" can also be read as ""Mei"" and thus the name ""Maze"" comes from the term ""Meis"" as in ""two Meis"".

Although it would seem his devotion lies with Jaina, he is actually extremely protective of his little brother. When Chic and Gorgeous were children, young Gorgeous was forced to kill someone who tried to abuse them, his Form burning down their home. It was Chic who comforted the other, and tried to lead them. The brothers ended up wandering the Wastelands, and they would have died on their own - if Jaina and the Creator had not taken them in. 

Chic vowed to give all he had to repay his debt to Jaina, and he is a swift tactician with a wicked sense of justice. Chic is often represented as moral yet misunderstood, and his character is often portrayed in a sympathetic light. Whereas Gorgeous' only goal was to gain power for his beautiful self, Chic is a genuinely noble person who strongly fights for the wrong side in order to protect what he values most. 

After Gorgeous is killed by Maze, Chic becomes consumed with rage. He battles the female Maze in his black Demi-Armor, Gorgon, to avenge his brother's death, even going against the Creator's orders. Though Maze doesn't want to fight him, in the end, she ultimately kills Chic to protect those she loves. 

His name is always mispronounced as ""Chick"" instead of the correct ""Sheek"".

Saito Hiraga, the main male character, is from Earth (specifically Tokyo, Japan). At the time of the summoning, he had just picked up his laptop after attempting to get it repaired in Akihabara. A portal of some kind opened in front of him; and Saito's curiosity getting the better of him, he touched it and was sucked through. At first, Saito had no idea where he was, and was thoroughly disoriented. When he arrives on the other side however he is made to sit and obey like a normal household dog. When the bond of him being her familiar, involves having a kiss with the familiar, he is quite shocked at why they do it. In the anime, he also could not identify nor understand the language the students were speaking, but after Louise attempts to cast a silence spell on him that fails, he could understand and communicate with others as though they were speaking Japanese. It is not clear whether he was actually gifted with full knowledge of their language, or whether the misfired spell was similar in principle to a universal translator. This was not the case in the light novel though, where he does understand their language; like the names of the characters, the language spoken by them is also French.

There are Runes inscribed into Saito's hand as a result of his being bound to Louise. They read geboundolf or Gundolf meaning Gandálfr (ガンダールヴ, Gandāruvu?). These runes glow when his Gandálfr powers activate. As a Gandálfr, Saito has the ability to use any object that was made with the intent of being used as a weapon at an extremely high level of skill. He also becomes significantly stronger, faster and tougher. Even weapons that he had never touched before, such as an M-72 rocket launcher and a World War II Zero Fighter, can be instantly understood and utilized. This physical augmentation fades more or less instantly when he stops using the power, which can result in him falling unconscious if he'd been wounded previously. That he can only use items specifically crafted for the purpose of weapons was revealed by Derflinger after a failed attempt to use an ornamental sword. It has not been made clear whether Gandálfr powers could be used in conjunction with purely magical weaponry such as a wand or a staff. Even with these abilities he doesn't defend himself at all against Louise's constant beatings.

The series constantly implies him being a pervert and sometimes he does think exactly like one, but justifiably, he is a young single guy who isn't married to anyone. Louise just enforces an ownership type arrangement over Saito implying she is owed Saito's feelings. It is later revealed that Saito has feelings for Louise and even says it openly to her.

Saito also has a bit of a troublesome and somewhat complicated tendency of getting involved with women. Strange and oddly sexual things happen when he seemingly becomes intimate with another girl. A few examples are when Kirche or even Siesta try to gain his attention, by mostly sexual seduction. When he meets or speaks to an attractive girl, he is often only noticing her chest in a few instances . This is actually one of the main reasons why Louise treats him so poorly as he is expected to be perfect in every way in her childish mindset.

Although he acts a bit perverted at times, this does not mean that he does not think of Louise. Similar to how she feels whenever he is becoming intimate with another girl (specifically with large breasts) Saito can get very upset when it comes to Louise and other men. He dislikes Julio for his ""snobbish"" interest in Louise, especially since he is adored by all the other young girls in Tristain Academy. He becomes extremely jealous and calls him a bastard whenever he tries to touch Louise or gain her attention. He also becomes upset he hears of Louise being married off to someone else. When his friends dragged him into a hole to peep at the girls while they were bathing, he was extremely protective of Louise and stopped them before they saw her naked.He uses the name ""My Louise"" several times in the light novels when he feels jealous toward other guys. This is definite evidence of his strong feelings for Louise.

His partner, the talking sword Derflinger, was also the partner of the Gandálfr from six-thousand years ago. His advice and comments never reflect well on Saito. Saito protects Louise because he is her familiar, and it is later shown that he has feelings for her as well, claiming ""All that he is good at is protecting her."" He is revealed to be a Gandálfr, a familiar who exists to protect a Void Wizard as they cast their spells. Even when this fact becomes known to Louise, she still physically assaults him, while Saito is seen often shrugging it off as his fault. Saito was given the nickname ""Our Sword"" by the head cook in episode three, where Louise takes Saito into town to purchase a weapon for him, which happens to be the legendary sword Derflinger. By the beginning of the third series, the magical runes on Saito's hand mysteriously disappear, and Saito's position of Gandálfr is in question. He regains them when he is re-summoned by Louise. With the return of runes, Saito is knighted for the feat of stopping an entire army by himself, and given a hero's welcome at the Academy. Saito is named after Gennai Hiraga who is an Edo period Japanese scientist, and his name is written as ""ability man.""",Main,"Hino, Satoshi, Meza, Jonathan, Kim, Jang, Albarracín, Luisma, Torres, José Ángel, Keller, Patrick","Japanese, English, Korean, Spanish, Spanish, German","https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/62832.jpg?s=25d1f3f058ad0e1cf56615b5130ca712, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/3492.jpg?s=5cc3f1063a02f7f237515a5e182645ea, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/15465.jpg?s=17e56eaffc44d5119167c1a7c43a298e, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/49892.jpg?s=437af8b67785f53f7dbdf85dde39a519, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/68783.jpg?s=4fcb5efc93f8e2b9c52fe137548c9c80, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/23959.jpg?s=10dda7be321271c5dca3f6e541b6b655"

Louise Françoise Le Blanc de La Vallière is the main female character. She is a second year student at the Tristain Academy of Magic and a terrible mage who is often scorned by her fellow classmates. Because every spell she casts fails, she is nicknamed ""Louise the Zero"" after her zero percent success rate.

Even though it takes her a long time to admit it, she quickly falls in love with the familiar she summons, a human by the name of Saito.

This mammal digimon has also been considered to look like a mouse or pig with wings.

Patamon is a main character in Digimon Adventure and Digimon Adventure 02, as well as the movies Digimon Adventure (The movie), Our War Game!, The Golden Digimentals and Diaboromon Strikes Back. Patamon also appears as a supporting character in Digimon Frontier.

Patamon is the playful Digimon partner of Takeru. In Digimon Adventure, Patamon was the last of the Digi-Destined Digimon to achieve his Champion form, and the last again to achieve his Ultimate form. However, both his Champion and Ultimate forms are immensely powerful for their respective level, and are responsible for defeating Devimon and the final Dark Master, Piedmon respectively.

Takeru returns as a main character in the second Digimon Adventure 02 season, as does Patamon. Because of the Digimon Emperor's control spires, Patamon was no longer able to Digivolve into his Champion form, and instead fought in his Armor form when he uses the Digi-Egg of Hope - Pegasusmon. In the 2020 series, Patamon can Digivolve to Pegasusmon without the Digi-Egg of Hope.

In the series, Patamon has a childish and sensitive personality.

Attacks:

Boom Bubble (Air Shot): Patamon's body inflates as he gulps in air - which he then shoots forward from his mouth.

Slamming Attack (Body Slam): Patamon charges at his enemy attempting to knock them out (This attack is very rarely used).

In the dub, she speaks in a soft, drawling voice. The Japanese version, however, has her in a much older voice to reflect her maturity as an adult level Digimon. As Plotmon, she acts more youthful like many of the Child level Digimon. Her name, ""Gatomon,"" comes from ""gato,"" which means ""cat"" in Spanish, Greek, and Portuguese.

Tailmon first appeared in Digimon Adventure as a malicious Digimon working for Vamdemon. As a Digi-Egg, Tailmon had been separated from the other seven Chosen Digimon. When she later digivolved into Plotmon, Vamdemon took her under his wing. Plotmon eventually naturally evolved into Tailmon and became one of Vamdemon's lieutenants in his army of Digimon. During this time, she gained a rival in one of his other minions, PicoDevimon, as the two competed for their master's favor. Her only friend was Wizarmon, a friendly Digimon who Tailmon had once helped. Tailmon also bears red X-shaped scars from when Vamdemon ""beat"" her because he did not like her eyes.

Takeru is the youngest Chosen Child out of the core seven. He is gentle, sweet-natured, and generous. He is also obedient and follows the Chosen Children's lead without complaints. He is also described as Hikari Yagami's ""equal.""

Takeru is the only Chosen Child to not attend the same school as the rest of the others initially due to living in Sangenjaya instead of Odaiba. He is younger brother of Yamato, but lives with his mother, journalist Natsuko Takaishi, instead due to a divorce between their parents. 

Although Takeru was too young to remember the events of the divorce clearly, he is still affected by it and does not like to openly talk about it. Despite the distance between him and Yamato, he admires Yamato greatly and tries to be brave to ""impress"" him, although he begins to open up to the other Chosen Children as well, particularly Taichi.

In the sequel, Digimon Adventure 02, Takeru and his mother relocate to a new apartment building in Odaiba, where he becomes neighbors with Iori Hida and Miyako Inoue. Although he has gotten remarkably taller, his gentle personality has not changed and it makes him popular with the girls at school. He is also said to have ""inherited reliability from Yamato.""

His dark powers eventually grew too powerful to be controlled, and he created legions with his ability to transform good monsters into his evil servants for the purpose of destroying the world. The surviving scientists created the one creature capable of defeating Moo, the Phoenix. They battled, but proved to be closely matched. Realizing that they had no other choice, the scientists created a machine that would put an end to the war of the monsters, but they knew that it would affect all monsters. Using the machine, Moo's spirit and the Phoenix's spirit were separated from their bodies, and all other monsters became sealed into Mystery Disks. Moo's soul became a Mystery Disk imprisoned in his castle, along with the Mystery Disks containing many of his old troops. 

Centuries later, after he was banished from his village, Holly's father went in search of the Phoenix without the aid of the Magic Stone, but found Moo's castle instead. When he unintentionally unlocked Moo's soul, it entered his body and thus Moo was reborn. He reassembled his army with his Big Bad Four enforcing his injustice and terrorizing the world while in search of the location of his old body. After kidnapping Holly, he told her that he was her father. Although she did not want to believe it at first, he showed her the dagger that her father once had. Moo then used the Magic Stone to point out the location of his ancient body. Thanks to a little interference from Holly's companions and Pixie, the stone was taken from him and given back to Holly and they fled to escape his clutches. Moo flew to the North in his Castle and ordered his minions to begin an excavation so that he could find his ancient body. He found it, but failed to merge with it. The discovery of the machine that had been used to defeat him allowed his servants to use it and allow him to fuse with his body. With his body back, Moo immediately flew to meet Genki and his friends and destroy them. Despite the fact that Pixie helped them, Moo was still victorious. When they seemed defeated, the sun rose over the horizon causing him pain. He fled in confusion and sought to solve whatever problem had occurred. After obtaining the Magic Stone from the treacherous General Durahan who had it stolen from Holly, Moo perfected his body. He once again went to finish what he had failed to do earlier, however this time he made the mistake of absorbing too much of everyone's hatred (which normally makes him stronger) and allowing his mind to be consumed by the darkness in his own heart, driving him insane. After the Phoenix arose, the enraged Moo and the Phoenix destroyed each other. Though his body was destroyed, Moo's soul was sealed inside a mystery disc with Holly's father. General Durahan tried to absorb Moo's soul, but the fusion created a Ruby Knight with Moo's personality. Moo's soul was later destroyed by Genki's group.

Eventually, they built a pack of mixed-breed Tigers. When Tiger first met Moo, the giant monster killed every last member of Tiger's pack, and kidnapped Gray Wolf, leaving Tiger to die. Tiger would later find out the cold, harsh truth of what happened to his brother. Tiger was the Phoenix's anger.

He is also surprisingly strong for a 10-year old (he has shown to be able to lift objects several times his own weight from time to time in the series), although whether this is due to his own innate strength or because he is in the game world (thereby having been subjected to some game mechanic) is not known.

Umi Ryuuzaki is the Magic Knight of Water. Despite being a beautiful and elegant girl, with a tall model-like figure and long, flowing blue hair, she actually has a short temper, and was initially shown to be the most skeptical of the three. Later on, however, between the three Magic Knights, she took on the mantle of the Big Sister and proved to be very protective of her two best friends, Fuu Hououji and Hikaru Shidou.

Hikaru is one of the three Magic Knights summoned to Cephiro by Princess Emeraude; the knight of fire (as her names implies. Hikaru means ""Light of the Lion Shrine"").

She is the smallest of the three knights, often mistaken for an elementary student and considered a bit tomboyish by her classmates. Despite her height, and her apparent naïveté, she can be quite fierce and strong when the needs calls for it. Underneath her ever-present smiles and innocence, there lies a the spirit of a warrior who is determined to protect her friends and everyone's happiness. Even at the cost of her own.

Because of this, as the series evolves, she is the one who is most affected—physically and mentally—by all the brutality and war around her. Nonetheless, Hikaru keeps a strong facade, trying not to worry Umi and Fuu who she considers her most precious friends, despite only having met them moments before being dragged into Cephiro.

As the true reasons for their summon come to light, and Hikaru is forced to act with Umi and Fuu to kill both Zagato and a grief-stricken Emeraude, her heart overflows with pain and self-hate and she unwittingly burns a shadow—Nova—across the surface of Cephiro before being transported back to Earth.

During the second season, she is forced to battle her other self-Nova is vengeful and maliciously possessive of her, causing more heartache and troubles—and her own blooming feelings for Kail Lantis.

At first, Hikaru approaches him, feeling guilty for the death of his brother, and begs him to hate only her, to hit only her but not to hurt Umi or Fuu. The moment Lantis tells her that she shouldn't blame herself, as it wasn't her fault but destiny, is most likely the moment when she starts falling for him. Without knowing it.

Throughout the entire second season, she and Lantis are brought together many times, by circumstances, and it is not until Nova points out that she is very much in love with Lantis that Hikaru realizes it herself.

After a grueling battle, in her own mind, to reforge the sword that Nova managed to break, Hikaru comes out victorious and, on the verge of blacking out in Lantis's arms, confesses to him that she loves him. She does not remember it after she wakes up but the feelings are still alive in her heart and Nova takes advantage of them time and time again.

Despite the animosity between Cephiro and the three invading countries, she manages to befriend Eagle Vision of Autozam, making Eagle a sort of bridge between both his friends.

At one point in the anime, Eagle and Hikaru both become candidates for the Pillar position but it is Hikaru who is chosen in the end and makes a wish to rid Cephiro of its oppressive system; wishing for Cephiro to be created by all those who love it.

In the manga, Hikaru's feeling for Lantis is less mature and she likes both Lantis and Eagle Vision. When Lantis asked her in final chapter who she wants to marry, she answered, that she wants to marry him and Eagle. Also bond between Hikaru and Eagle Vision is stronger in manga, because in manga she fought with him for the position of the Pillar, defeated him and then saved his life against the will of the Creator.

However, she fell in love with the high priest, Zagato, and for this love became his servant, although the affection is entirely one-sided. In the manga, she is killed after failing Zagato not once but twice. In the anime, she lives on until near the end of the second series; few after Zagato and Esmeraude's deaths, she's captured by the evil witch Debonair, who brainwashes her into becoming her slave. Lantis captures Alcyone in battle, but she has lost her memories; when she recovers them, she reveals Debonair's plans for Cephiro and Debonair's location, but her former mistress kills her before she can finish.

In the Sega Saturn game, Alcyone appears to die, then comes back near the end of the game in the later part of Zagato's palace.

Her name is occasionally misromanized as ""Alcione""--this was featured in the first run of the English-language manga. Her name comes from the Subaru Alcyone SVX. In the Spanish version of the anime, she is called Alanis.

Although hideous, they have no ill will, but villagers still fear them. Thus, Ascot was driven away until Zagato offered to give him and his friends a home in exchange for serving under him. In the anime, he destroys Presea's house with his monsters, and essentially causes her death; later, he confronts the Knights again (their first encounter in the manga), but Umi slaps him for using his friends and causing them pain. This causes a change of heart in Ascot, and he then forsakes Zagato. In the second series, he has used the power of his own will to make himself into an adult because of his love for Umi. Also, he still summons monsters but has learned other spells from Clef to avoid using his friends as living weapons.

In the anime he is able to tell Umi his feelings before she leaves to fight Tarta. Umi replies that she loves him as well, but just as much as everyone else in Cephiro, and that she didn't have any romantic feelings for him. This saddens Ascot a bit, but he still tries to win her heart later on.

Saito Hiraga, the main male character, is from Earth (specifically Tokyo, Japan). At the time of the summoning, he had just picked up his laptop after attempting to get it repaired in Akihabara. A portal of some kind opened in front of him; and Saito's curiosity getting the better of him, he touched it and was sucked through. At first, Saito had no idea where he was, and was thoroughly disoriented. When he arrives on the other side however he is made to sit and obey like a normal household dog. When the bond of him being her familiar, involves having a kiss with the familiar, he is quite shocked at why they do it. In the anime, he also could not identify nor understand the language the students were speaking, but after Louise attempts to cast a silence spell on him that fails, he could understand and communicate with others as though they were speaking Japanese. It is not clear whether he was actually gifted with full knowledge of their language, or whether the misfired spell was similar in principle to a universal translator. This was not the case in the light novel though, where he does understand their language; like the names of the characters, the language spoken by them is also French.

There are Runes inscribed into Saito's hand as a result of his being bound to Louise. They read geboundolf or Gundolf meaning Gandálfr (ガンダールヴ, Gandāruvu?). These runes glow when his Gandálfr powers activate. As a Gandálfr, Saito has the ability to use any object that was made with the intent of being used as a weapon at an extremely high level of skill. He also becomes significantly stronger, faster and tougher. Even weapons that he had never touched before, such as an M-72 rocket launcher and a World War II Zero Fighter, can be instantly understood and utilized. This physical augmentation fades more or less instantly when he stops using the power, which can result in him falling unconscious if he'd been wounded previously. That he can only use items specifically crafted for the purpose of weapons was revealed by Derflinger after a failed attempt to use an ornamental sword. It has not been made clear whether Gandálfr powers could be used in conjunction with purely magical weaponry such as a wand or a staff. Even with these abilities he doesn't defend himself at all against Louise's constant beatings.

The series constantly implies him being a pervert and sometimes he does think exactly like one, but justifiably, he is a young single guy who isn't married to anyone. Louise just enforces an ownership type arrangement over Saito implying she is owed Saito's feelings. It is later revealed that Saito has feelings for Louise and even says it openly to her.

Saito also has a bit of a troublesome and somewhat complicated tendency of getting involved with women. Strange and oddly sexual things happen when he seemingly becomes intimate with another girl. A few examples are when Kirche or even Siesta try to gain his attention, by mostly sexual seduction. When he meets or speaks to an attractive girl, he is often only noticing her chest in a few instances . This is actually one of the main reasons why Louise treats him so poorly as he is expected to be perfect in every way in her childish mindset.

Although he acts a bit perverted at times, this does not mean that he does not think of Louise. Similar to how she feels whenever he is becoming intimate with another girl (specifically with large breasts) Saito can get very upset when it comes to Louise and other men. He dislikes Julio for his ""snobbish"" interest in Louise, especially since he is adored by all the other young girls in Tristain Academy. He becomes extremely jealous and calls him a bastard whenever he tries to touch Louise or gain her attention. He also becomes upset he hears of Louise being married off to someone else. When his friends dragged him into a hole to peep at the girls while they were bathing, he was extremely protective of Louise and stopped them before they saw her naked.He uses the name ""My Louise"" several times in the light novels when he feels jealous toward other guys. This is definite evidence of his strong feelings for Louise.

His partner, the talking sword Derflinger, was also the partner of the Gandálfr from six-thousand years ago. His advice and comments never reflect well on Saito. Saito protects Louise because he is her familiar, and it is later shown that he has feelings for her as well, claiming ""All that he is good at is protecting her."" He is revealed to be a Gandálfr, a familiar who exists to protect a Void Wizard as they cast their spells. Even when this fact becomes known to Louise, she still physically assaults him, while Saito is seen often shrugging it off as his fault. Saito was given the nickname ""Our Sword"" by the head cook in episode three, where Louise takes Saito into town to purchase a weapon for him, which happens to be the legendary sword Derflinger. By the beginning of the third series, the magical runes on Saito's hand mysteriously disappear, and Saito's position of Gandálfr is in question. He regains them when he is re-summoned by Louise. With the return of runes, Saito is knighted for the feat of stopping an entire army by himself, and given a hero's welcome at the Academy. Saito is named after Gennai Hiraga who is an Edo period Japanese scientist, and his name is written as ""ability man.""",Main,"Hino, Satoshi, Kim, Jang, Keller, Patrick","Japanese, Korean, German","https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/62832.jpg?s=25d1f3f058ad0e1cf56615b5130ca712, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/15465.jpg?s=17e56eaffc44d5119167c1a7c43a298e, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/23959.jpg?s=10dda7be321271c5dca3f6e541b6b655"

Runic Name: Louise the Zero (Zero no Louise)

Louise Françoise Le Blanc de La Vallière is the main female character. She is a second year student at the Tristain Academy of Magic and a terrible mage who is often scorned by her fellow classmates. Because every spell she casts fails, she is nicknamed ""Louise the Zero"" after her zero percent success rate. She is the third daughter of the noble family La Vallière who owns the north-eastern territory of Tristain. Even though it takes her a long time to admit it, she quickly falls in love with the familiar she summons, a human by the name of Saito.

    Captain of Tristain musketeers in service of Henrietta. She's shown as a military woman who's very strict in discipline. She also is shown to hate Mages, especially those who used fire element. Even though her feelings on mages is known, she doesn't do anything to defend Saito due to misunderstandings by Louise that happen in front of her. Agnes often emphasized that mages should not become dependent of their magic, because in battles, there will be no time to cast spells before the enemy's swords and guns. At one point she kisses Louise to provide cover when Louise gasps while the two of them are eavesdropping on a pair of conspirators. The kiss she gave Louise and the commentary Siesta made about her implies Agnès is a lesbian, although she is most portrayed as being uninterested in sexual pursuits and only worried about fighting and revenge. She first appears in the second season. In the third season, upon finding Colbert was alive, she gives up her want for vengeance, deciding to end the hatred so his students wouldn't hate her for killing him.

In the light novels, after Saito confronted the advancing Albion army(Volume 7:Chapter 9) and then saved by Tiffania(VOlume 8), she was asked by Henrietta to find Saito and then found him in Tiffania's village, though Saito having lost his Gandalfr powers and said he is now useless and just a normal person and asked her to tell the Queen that he's already dead. She then trains Saito and even comments to Derflinger that Saito had made her serious when they had a spar.

Yasuaki is an Onmyōji, and the successor to the famous, historical Onmyōji Abe no Seimei.

Unlike his fellow Hachiyou, Yasuaki was not ""born"" a human, but created through Abe no Seimei's magical skill, and crafted into his current form through that same ability (in the manga he even talks about Seimei using a Tengu's power to help form him, although this is not explained in the anime). For this reason, despite having the physical appearance of a twenty one year old adult male, Yasuaki has only actually been alive for two years. This in many ways explains his emotional simplicity and naivety, since he has not yet learnt many of the things his companions have grown up absorbing.

For the most part, Yasuaki is a composed, detached individual that operates largely on logic and is sometimes perceived as cold or strange. When it appears that Eisen will die if he exorcises the eight-stringed Kin, Yasuaki states the fact bluntly and without any concern because he sees it simply in black and white - to save the Miko, a Hachiyou must be prepared to do his duty. As he puts it - ""If there is no Miko, there is no point in the Hachiyou."" 

When Yasuaki was ""born"", Seimei told him he had been born to find someone important to him, and that he lacked something as a person - a heart - which could not be crafted. For this reason, Yasuaki has accepted his master's words as meaning he's not a ""real person"", and therefore does not count in the same way as his Hachiyou companions. He believes he is the Miko's ""tool"" - in the manga, he is worried that he is ""broken"" because he can no longer read Akane's heart (although Akane explains to him that that just makes him like every other person, and that he's not broken at all)

In the anime he tells her that ""a tool that no longer works has no option but to be destroyed"" after Shirin tells him that he will never be able to find the Northern Seal. In the anime, his ignorance of human feelings make him tell Ran the memories that to that point had been concealed from her, driving her back to the Oni clan and causing a lot of trouble for the Hachiyou.

Yasuaki is an Onmyōji, and the successor to the famous, historical Onmyōji Abe no Seimei.

Unlike his fellow Hachiyou, Yasuaki was not ""born"" a human, but created through Abe no Seimei's magical skill, and crafted into his current form through that same ability (in the manga he even talks about Seimei using a Tengu's power to help form him, although this is not explained in the anime). For this reason, despite having the physical appearance of a twenty one year old adult male, Yasuaki has only actually been alive for two years.

For the most part, Yasuaki is a composed, detached individual that operates largely on logic and is sometimes perceived as cold or strange. When it appears that Eisen will die if he exorcises the eight-stringed Kin, Yasuaki states the fact bluntly and without any concern because he sees it simply in black and white - to save the Miko, a Hachiyou must be prepared to do his duty. As he puts it - ""If there is no Miko, there is no point in the Hachiyou."" 

When Yasuaki was ""born"", Seimei told him he had been born to find someone important to him, and that he lacked something as a person - a heart - which could not be crafted. For this reason, Yasuaki has accepted his master's words as meaning he's not a ""real person"", and therefore does not count in the same way as his Hachiyou companions. He believes he is the Miko's ""tool"" - in the manga, he is worried that he is ""broken"" because he can no longer read Akane's heart (although Akane explains to him that that just makes him like every other person, and that he's not broken at all)

In the anime he tells her that ""a tool that no longer works has no option but to be destroyed"" after Shirin tells him that he will never be able to find the Northern Seal. In the anime, his ignorance of human feelings make him tell Ran the memories that to that point had been concealed from her, driving her back to the Oni clan and causing a lot of trouble for the Hachiyou.

Souma is in love with Kureha and is sometimes annoyed at Kiriya for not noticing her feelings for him. He then confessed his love for her, which apparently was not mutual, shortly before being transported to the other world. After seeing Kureha presumably die, he was able to pull out a legendary sword from Kureha's body. Souma turned out to be a 'Soul Blader', which is a person that can form a sword from the heart of a person he shares emotions with. Unlike Kureha, Souma would rather stay in End Earth, as he believes that it is the right place for him and since he thinks that he can be ""together"" with Kureha.

He later had Kiriya and Seena take care of Kureha while he wanted to take care of a few things on his own. Though he is a Soul Blader, he no longer wanted to use Touka's heart since he knew that her heart loved Kiriya. Instead, he started to use a katana.

When Souma and Kureha were between dimensions, they were greeted by Zero, who entrusted Souma in guarding the world from then on. Souma received one of the two twin dragon rings from Zero.

When he tells his friends, the group dismisses the message as they believe it to only be a dream. Kiriya is a skilled swordsman; ranging from kendo to fencing. It is said that no one could beat him if he was to fight seriously. The cherry blossom of their college transports him and Seena to End Earth right after Souma and Kureha, taking the entire building as well. He becomes the knight for an independent mercenary group called the 'Luminous Knights', which is started by Seena.

Like Souma, Kiriya is also a Soul Blader, who uses Seena's ""heart"" as a sword. Kiriya is completely oblivious to Kureha's and Seena's feelings for him, the latter being one of his childhood friends. He later forms a close bond with an elf named Xecty, who is later revealed to be an artificial recreation of the Elven Queen. Until Xecty's death, he was confident in his mission to have Saionji admit defeat. Since the start of the war, his attitude shifted from his shy and quiet self, to a rash and emotional state, who sees that fighting is the only way to win (the complete opposite to Souma's change of behavior).

He is later revealed to hold Souma's Holy Grail, Souma's Ultimate Soul Blade (究極心剣, Kyūkyoku Shinken?). The one who holds his Holy Grail is Xecty.

In the end, he chooses to return to his own world, together with Kureha and Seena.

Status: Demon King (Maoh), engaged to Wolfram von Bielefeld.
Clothing: Black Japanese School Uniform described by von Christ as cloaked in the night.

The stories protagonist. Born and grew up in Saitama prefecture. A high school student who enjoys baseball more than textbooks. He was 'named' by Conrad when he mentioned to Yuri's mother how, where he comes from, Yuri means July. Early in the show, bullies make fun of Yuri's name by calling him ""Shibuya Yūri, Harajuku Fūri"" (advantage Shibuya, disadvantage Harajuku)—a reference to popular districts of Tokyo. In the English dub, this becomes a pun on ""Yuri is short for urine.""

When Yuri arrives in Shin Makoku, he is declared the 27th Maoh of the Mazoku (""Demon Race""). Yuri easily gets caught up in his emotions to the point of losing control of himself. He is a little bit quick to anger, and once he's on a rampage he can't even stop himself. A music teacher he once had dubbed his rants ""the Turkish march."" When he is angry or sad or has a strong emotion his natural powers emerge. Yuri uses expressions from historical dramas when he gets this way, which probably has to do with the fact that he loves historical dramas. They call this condition is sometimes called ""Maou mode"" (「上様モード」 in Japanese, ""emperor mode""). In the anime this form can be recognized mainly by the longer hair and demon eyes. He can summon powerful magic (majutsu), even in the human territories (a notable feat as most Mazoku cannot perform magic outside their country), and even more remarkable he can use majutsu in souseki filled areas such as the souseki mines where other mazoku have difficulty standing and even breathing. Yuri's magic is manifested in various shapes—usually one or more great water dragons, or some messy magical ""creature"" made from mud, food morsels etc. After spending time in this form, Yuri becomes worn out and in some cases passes out and doesn't remember what happened afterwards. Later, Yuri learns to control his power and uses it to close the first of the Forbidden Boxes. In the beginning of season 1, he often fainted after he used Maryokou (especially in Human land) due to exhaustion. But later on he was able to maintain his consciousness after returning to his ""former self.""

Yuri has many allies and friends. His closest allies are Wolfram, Conrad, Günter, Gwendal, Murata, and Josak. They help Yuri throughout the series. At his first encounter with Wolfram von Bielefeld he ends up engaged to him due to a mishap: Wolfram, angry that Yuri has been chosen as the Maoh, makes the mistake of insulting Yuri's mother—which earns him a slap. Slapping another noble on his or her left cheek is the way in which Mazoku propose marriage (some consider the slap as unmanly, but Yuri explains in the light novel that he only slapped Wolfram because he has a beautiful face, otherwise he would have punched him). Incensed by this insult, Wolfram challenges Yuri to a duel, which is also mistakenly accepted because of Yuri's unfamiliarity with Mazoku custom (he picked up the knife that fell off the table).



Throughout the series, his main goal is to create a world in which Mazoku and humans can live together in peace, something that progresses slowly but surely as the series goes on.

Wolfram is a mazoku man who finds himself engaged to Yuuri after a cultural mistake. He is a ""bishounen,"" which means a pretty or beautiful boy. He is quite androgynous looking, with a notably beautiful face, shoulder-length hair and long eyelashes. His appearance is so influential, that several dying people in the hospital have a miraculous recovery after laying eyes on him. Wolfram possesses fire magic, as well as being adept with a sword. He is the half-brother of Conrad and Gwendal. He has extremely high pride as a demon and is hot-headed. He is arrogant and short-tempered but can also show a compassionate side at times. He is the only one of the previous queen's three sons who inherited her emerald green eyes and blonde hair, bearing a striking resemblance to her. In his mother's words, it seems he inherited his looks from her but his temperamental personality from his late father. Wolfram is obsessed with Yuuri and insists on following him everywhere as he claims it is his duty to protect his fiancé, though he also seems to want to prevent him from cheating on him. His ancestor, Rufus Bielefield, fought alongside the Original King (the great one).

Near the end of the second season, there is a time when Wolfram is possessed by Original King, who in turned was possessed by Soushu. The key he possesses, his heart, is ripped out by Original King in order to open one of the four boxes, ""Hellfire in Frozen Land"" (""Hellfire on Frozen Tundra"" in Japanese translation). Because of this, Wolfram temporarily dies, but is revived when the Original King returns the keys to their owners.

Wolfram is the youngest son of the former Maou, Cecilie von Spitzweig. He initially dislikes humans, even Conrad's father. Because of his mazoku pride, he does not like to admit that Conrad is his brother, even though he cares for Conrad (Wolfram always referred to Conrad by his last name—Lord Weller; however, after Conrad's return from his supposed betrayal, Wolfram refers to Conrad by his first name). In the graphic novels, it is hinted that this hatred towards humans stems from his late father's prejudice against humans. His liking for humans improves throughout the series, progressing to the point that he adopts the human girl Greta as his daughter, starts acknowledging Yuuri's parents as his future ""in-laws"" and also runs into a raging fire to save a human child.

Years ago when he was a child, Wolfram accidentally slapped Elizabeth, Raven's niece, on her left cheek. Elizabeth never forgot this incident, insisting that they swore everlasting love that day, while Wolfram insists he forgot why he slapped her in the first place. Some time after collecting three of the Four Forbidden Boxes, Elizabeth becomes Stoffel's tool to separate Yuuri from the three brothers, pronouncing an engagement proposal to Yuuri. Elizabeth's real goal is to marry Wolfram, but Wolfram says that his only fiance is Yuuri. During the duel which ensues, (as Yuuri accidentally picked up a knife and a fork pointing it at Elizabeth; symbolizing a fight to settle a triangle love affair), Yuuri turns into the Maou, protecting Wolfram from being hurt by fire majutsu that Elizabeth summoned. He proclaims the two go on the date and remember their childhood memories. It is eventually learned that Wolfram slapped Elizabeth because he wanted to touch a butterfly that flew past, and Conrad was watching the entire event.

Wolfram is an extremely ""pretty"" person—Yuuri calls him this upon first meeting him (specifically using the term ""bishōnen"" in the Japanese version and very often in the light novel). This is also why Yuuri slapped Wolfram when he badmouthed Yuuri's mother instead of punching him, stating that it's a pity to dirty such a pretty face (Source: the novels). This image is enhanced by his choice of nightwear—a frilly nightgown that contrasts violently with his rather quick temper.

When he first becomes engaged to Yuuri, he is extremely upset, but the idea quickly grows on him. He takes the engagement much more seriously than Yuuri does. He follows Yuuri practically everywhere so he can keep an eye on him and even sneaks into Yuuri's bedroom at night. He gets extremely jealous when Yuuri talks to a girl or good-looking guy and often accuses him of being unfaithful which is sometimes used as comic relief, but as a character he is popular between fans and is considered to be the anime's breakout character. Even if he does not like to admit it, the series hints that Wolfram deeply cares about Yuuri. He tends to think Yuuri can be saved from bad situations because of his cuteness. By the end of the anime, he is making blatant declarations of love.

A major weakness is that he gets sea-sick. Yuuri also says that Wolfram cannot paint well, even though he insists on painting. It is revealed that Wolfram used to paint impressively realistic portraits of his family, but got bored of realism at some point and decided to adopt a more abstract art style, much to Yuuri's disappointment.

During the end of season two and the beginning of season three, Wolfram is chosen by the Ten Noble Families of Shin Makoku (Christ, Voltaire, Grantz, Bielefeld, Karbelnikoff, Wincott, Spitzberg, Gyllenhaal, Rochefort, and Radford) to become the next Maou, due to the belief that Yuuri would not be able to return to Shin Makoku at the time. When Yuuri does in fact return, Wolfram's uncle, Waltorana, places pressure on Wolfram to obtain the throne. Because of this, Wolfram dissolves the engagement with Yuuri and travels back to his homelands, in hopes that he would not be used to sabotage Yuuri.

Discovering of Wolfram's predicament, Yuuri and his retainers travel to the Bielefeld lands in the hopes of persuading Wolfram to return to Blood Pledge Castle, only to be forced into a formal duel by Wolfram himself. The battle becomes quite intense, as Wolfram gives his all against Yuuri and Yuuri trying his best to persuade Wolfram to stop the duel. At the climax, Yuuri was forced to protect himself by becoming the Maou and, angered by Wolfram's reckless dueling, prepares to hit Wolfram with a potentially fatal attack. In the process of hitting Wolfram with the attack, Yuuri watched as Wolfram prepared himself for what seems to be his last moment and gave his final words to Yuuri: ""Yuuri. Be a good king."" Realizing that Wolfram had planned the whole thing from the beginning so Yuuri could remain the Maou, Yuuri absorbed the attack onto himself at the last moment, sparring Wolfram of the damage. The Ten Noble Families then changed their decision to keep Yuuri as their king and Waltorana steps down from forcing Wolfram onto the throne. After a reconciliation between the two, Wolfram happily decides to annul the disengagement to a comically shocked Yuuri and proceeds to return to his normal attitude towards their engagement.

During the course of the series, Wolfram has grown exponentially from a spoiled prince to a selfless young man who stands by Yuuri with no question. Though, he had no plans of becoming Maou in the first place, he was willing to protect and serve Shin Makoku when it was resolved that Yuuri would not be returning back at the end of the second season, wanting to protect the beautiful job Yuuri did as Maou.

A teacher and swordsman who adores Yuuri. Günter is a skilled swordsman and magician but has retired to teach Yuuri about Shin Makoku and his future duties as the Maou. Günter once stated that he was the one who taught Conrad to ""become His Majesty's sword and shield"" indicating that perhaps Günter was once Conrad's teacher. When Günter accidentally travels to Earth, he becomes a model in New York City for a brief period of time so that he can earn money to find Yuuri. He is a very whimsical person and poetic in his thoughts. Günter is another test subject of Anissina.

Günter, along with the three brothers, helps Yuuri run the country. He is Yuuri's adviser and mentor, teaching him about various aspects of Shin Makoku. He usually spends his time doing numerous duties for both Yuuri and Shin Makoku.

When Günter was shot with a poisoned arrow containing the Wincott poison, his soul was temporarily housed in an Okiku Doll that flies, shoots lasers from its eyes, and has hair that grows naturally. During this time his body was known as Snow Günter and could be controlled by or released from the effects of the Wincott poison by anyone of the Von Wincott bloodline, like Julia's father and nephew.

Günter's personality is usually that of a good nature, but when he puts on his serious face he can be awe-inspiring. He has an extremely strong attachment to Yuuri and tends to pine when Yuuri has been gone from Shin Makoku for any considerable amount of time. He is very popular among women and men because of his good looks.

Günter's political views make a radical change due to Yuuri's influence. In the beginning, he was the one pushing most strongly for the war that would exterminate the human race. As the series goes on Yuuri's views are impressed upon him, and he begins to truly believe in and work for a peaceful alliance between Mazoku and humans.

Günter's only family seems to be his adopted daughter Gisela.

From the beginning, Gwendal has objections to Yuri becoming the Maoh. He is a skilled tactician and is capable of using earth magic and can cast barriers. When not otherwise busy, Gwendal indulges in his hobby of knitting and sewing but often his creatures look nothing like what they're supposed to (for example a bear got mistaken for a black pig or a cat that looks like a raccoon). He is adamnant that knitting helps him sharpen his concentration but actually its a stress reliever for him since childhood. He is also quite fond of cute animals or cute objects such as the dolphin keychain (Bandou-kun) Yuri received at the dolphin show and later gave to him. His childhood best friend is Anissina von Karbelnikoff, an inventor who often tests out her inventions on him, much to his displeasure. Anissina is also the one who taught Gwendal how to knit. Gwendal's left eye is a key to one of the four Forbidden Boxes, the ""End of the Earth"".

Gwendal is a tough guy except when it comes to his childhood friend, Anissina, and his brothers. He is afraid of Anissina and often hides from her so he can prevent being used in one of her crazy experiments. He is even seen sweating in panic at the thought of her. While he does not outwardly show much affection towards his brothers, he shows in times of great stress that he does care, an example being his decision to stand against the Original King to save his little brother, Wolfram. Jozak, who was sent to locate one of the Four Forbidden Boxes, tells Conrad that Gwendal really cares for Conrad's wellbeing and doesn't want Conrad to worry despite the Original King's wishes for Conrad to find the Boxes. His ancestor, Siegbert Voltaire, fought along the Original King.

When he was younger, Gwendal despised humans, a habit called the Mazoku Pride by Dunheely Weller. On Dunheely's last journey to a nameless village, he told Gwendal to enjoy the ride before their last duel. Upon arriving in the village, Gwendal is shocked that the village isn't recognized by Shin Makoku, and leads the attack on the bandits which targeted the village. In this duel, Gwendal sees Dunheely for who he really was, an old man, not the agile man he knew when he was younger. Dunheely later dies of old age, and Gwendal buries him near the tree where Dunheely told Gwendal what he was looking for. Years later while on a picnic with his family and Yuri, Gwendal admits that Dunheely was a larger existence than anyone else within him, because he hated that man.

Gwendal has no interest in love affairs, and even points out that issues coming from love affairs are beyond his abilities to influence. He does occasionally show care towards Greta, often being in charge of her while Yuri and Wolfram are in one of their adventures. Gwendal knows how to bake, as he does so for Greta when Günter, who would usually bake cookies for Greta, leaves the castle for a short journey. Greta comments that Gwendal's cookies look cute while Yuri comments Gwendal is good at baking as Gwendal's cookies are made into animal shapes, similar to the ones he knits. When Greta asks Gwendal if she is disturbing him while he is doing work, Gwendal says ""Since it's you, I don't mind"".

He is the commander of the demon army and often comes with reinforcements when Yuri finds himself in big trouble. He is also the one who does the paperwork and essentially runs the kingdom for Yuri. Often enough, when Yuri leaves the castle, Gunter is seen barging into Gwendal's office, demanding where Yuri is. Gwendal would usually look tired and suggest an idea which sounds appealing to Gunter, for example locking Yuri up in a room where no one will interfere.

Conrad is a swordsman (""the best swordsman in Shin Makoku"" - according to Wolfram) who looks after Yuuri. He possesses no maryoku (demonic magic) due to his mixed heritage of human and mazoku. His given name is Conrart; Yuuri nicknames him ""Conrad,"" which is ""closer to English"" and easier to pronounce with a Japanese tongue. Conrad is the second child of the previous Maou, Cecilie von Spitzweig. His father was human (also considered the greatest swordsman in the Demon Kingdom; Dan Hiri Weller). His ancestor, Lawrence Weller, fought alongside the Original King during the war against Soushu. As Conrad's father was not a Mazoku noble, he doesn't have ""von"" in his name.

On his 16th birthday, he decided to live as a Mazoku instead of a human. He fought on the front lines for the Mazoku during a war against the humans. He and Yozak are the only two survivors of the Battle of Lütenburg, and at the request of Julia von Wincott, he was also put in charge of the soul that was to be the new Maoh. He transported it safely to Earth so that it could be born.

Furthermore, he was the one who was the inspiration for Yuuri's name. He stated that ""Where I come from, the month of July is called Yuuri"", which made Yuuri's mother name him 'Yuuri' because he was born in July. For this reason, Yuuri dubs him 'Nazukeoya', which is a person who names someone (Conrad is also known as Yuuri's Godfather by his mother). Cecilie named the blue flowers she grew ""Conrad Stands Upon Earth"".

When Yuuri first came to Shin Makoku, Conrad was the one to find him (after some humans and Adelbert) and bring him safely to the castle. He acts as Yuuri's bodyguard and vows to protect Yuri with his life. He was described by Yuri as almost perfect with fine looks and a mild demeanor but he makes the worst jokes. Typically, he could be found with an unassuming smile on his face, and persists in calling Yuuri 'Heika (Your Majesty)' except in dire situations, and when Yuuri scolds him for it.



He was also very close to Suzanna Julia von Wincott, whose soul now resides inside Yuuri.

Saito Hiraga, the main male character, is from Earth (specifically Tokyo, Japan). At the time of the summoning, he had just picked up his laptop after attempting to get it repaired in Akihabara. A portal of some kind opened in front of him; and Saito's curiosity getting the better of him, he touched it and was sucked through. At first, Saito had no idea where he was, and was thoroughly disoriented. When he arrives on the other side however he is made to sit and obey like a normal household dog. When the bond of him being her familiar, involves having a kiss with the familiar, he is quite shocked at why they do it. In the anime, he also could not identify nor understand the language the students were speaking, but after Louise attempts to cast a silence spell on him that fails, he could understand and communicate with others as though they were speaking Japanese. It is not clear whether he was actually gifted with full knowledge of their language, or whether the misfired spell was similar in principle to a universal translator. This was not the case in the light novel though, where he does understand their language; like the names of the characters, the language spoken by them is also French.

There are Runes inscribed into Saito's hand as a result of his being bound to Louise. They read geboundolf or Gundolf meaning Gandálfr (ガンダールヴ, Gandāruvu?). These runes glow when his Gandálfr powers activate. As a Gandálfr, Saito has the ability to use any object that was made with the intent of being used as a weapon at an extremely high level of skill. He also becomes significantly stronger, faster and tougher. Even weapons that he had never touched before, such as an M-72 rocket launcher and a World War II Zero Fighter, can be instantly understood and utilized. This physical augmentation fades more or less instantly when he stops using the power, which can result in him falling unconscious if he'd been wounded previously. That he can only use items specifically crafted for the purpose of weapons was revealed by Derflinger after a failed attempt to use an ornamental sword. It has not been made clear whether Gandálfr powers could be used in conjunction with purely magical weaponry such as a wand or a staff. Even with these abilities he doesn't defend himself at all against Louise's constant beatings.

The series constantly implies him being a pervert and sometimes he does think exactly like one, but justifiably, he is a young single guy who isn't married to anyone. Louise just enforces an ownership type arrangement over Saito implying she is owed Saito's feelings. It is later revealed that Saito has feelings for Louise and even says it openly to her.

Saito also has a bit of a troublesome and somewhat complicated tendency of getting involved with women. Strange and oddly sexual things happen when he seemingly becomes intimate with another girl. A few examples are when Kirche or even Siesta try to gain his attention, by mostly sexual seduction. When he meets or speaks to an attractive girl, he is often only noticing her chest in a few instances . This is actually one of the main reasons why Louise treats him so poorly as he is expected to be perfect in every way in her childish mindset.

Although he acts a bit perverted at times, this does not mean that he does not think of Louise. Similar to how she feels whenever he is becoming intimate with another girl (specifically with large breasts) Saito can get very upset when it comes to Louise and other men. He dislikes Julio for his ""snobbish"" interest in Louise, especially since he is adored by all the other young girls in Tristain Academy. He becomes extremely jealous and calls him a bastard whenever he tries to touch Louise or gain her attention. He also becomes upset he hears of Louise being married off to someone else. When his friends dragged him into a hole to peep at the girls while they were bathing, he was extremely protective of Louise and stopped them before they saw her naked.He uses the name ""My Louise"" several times in the light novels when he feels jealous toward other guys. This is definite evidence of his strong feelings for Louise.

His partner, the talking sword Derflinger, was also the partner of the Gandálfr from six-thousand years ago. His advice and comments never reflect well on Saito. Saito protects Louise because he is her familiar, and it is later shown that he has feelings for her as well, claiming ""All that he is good at is protecting her."" He is revealed to be a Gandálfr, a familiar who exists to protect a Void Wizard as they cast their spells. Even when this fact becomes known to Louise, she still physically assaults him, while Saito is seen often shrugging it off as his fault. Saito was given the nickname ""Our Sword"" by the head cook in episode three, where Louise takes Saito into town to purchase a weapon for him, which happens to be the legendary sword Derflinger. By the beginning of the third series, the magical runes on Saito's hand mysteriously disappear, and Saito's position of Gandálfr is in question. He regains them when he is re-summoned by Louise. With the return of runes, Saito is knighted for the feat of stopping an entire army by himself, and given a hero's welcome at the Academy. Saito is named after Gennai Hiraga who is an Edo period Japanese scientist, and his name is written as ""ability man.""",Main,"Hino, Satoshi, Kim, Jang","Japanese, Korean","https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/62832.jpg?s=25d1f3f058ad0e1cf56615b5130ca712, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/15465.jpg?s=17e56eaffc44d5119167c1a7c43a298e"

Runic Name: Louise the Zero (Zero no Louise)

Louise Françoise Le Blanc de La Vallière is the main female character. She is a second year student at the Tristain Academy of Magic and a terrible mage who is often scorned by her fellow classmates. Because every spell she casts fails, she is nicknamed ""Louise the Zero"" after her zero percent success rate. She is the third daughter of the noble family La Vallière who owns the north-eastern territory of Tristain. Even though it takes her a long time to admit it, she quickly falls in love with the familiar she summons, a human by the name of Saito.

He can be considered a replacement for Guiche after his depart to the military service because he is similar to Guiche in looks—however, Julio is worldly, as opposed to the vain, foolish Guiche, and hardly had to exert effort to charm most of the female students in the Academy.

Even though her feelings on mages is known, she doesn't do anything to defend Saito due to misunderstandings by Louise that happen in front of her. Agnes often emphasized that mages should not become dependent of their magic, because in battles, there will be no time to cast spells before the enemy's swords and guns. At one point she kisses Louise to provide cover when Louise gasps while the two of them are eavesdropping on a pair of conspirators. The kiss she gave Louise and the commentary Siesta made about her implies Agnès is a lesbian, although she is most portrayed as being uninterested in sexual pursuits and only worried about fighting and revenge. She first appears in the second season. In the third season, upon finding Colbert was alive, she gives up her want for vengeance, deciding to end the hatred so his students wouldn't hate her for killing him.

In the light novels, after Saito confronted the advancing Albion army(Volume 7:Chapter 9) and then saved by Tiffania(VOlume 8), she was asked by Henrietta to find Saito and then found him in Tiffania's village, though Saito having lost his Gandalfr powers and said he is now useless and just a normal person and asked her to tell the Queen that he's already dead. She then trains Saito and even comments to Derflinger that Saito had made her serious when they had a spar.

He is the leader and most powerful of the turtle-like Koopa race.

Though their origins are unknown, Bowser has eight children; the seven Koopalings and Bowser Jr.

Bowser, or King Koopa, is perhaps most famous for his repeated kidnappings of Princess Peach. The reason for these kidnappings is often part of his plan to take over the Mushroom Kingdom.

He has several types of troops under his command, including Koopas, Goombas, and Piranha Plants.

Bowser's appearance has been tweaked several times throughout the series, but most of basic overall look has been consistent. He looks something like a cross between a turtle and a dragon. He is bipedal and able to walk around on two legs. Both his feet and his hands have large claws. He is noticably larger than all the other characters. He is mostly yellow with a green shell.

Goombas resemble small, brown mushrooms, and are a fungus-based species like Toads, Amanitas, Spooks, and Shroobs. Goombas are physically weak, and aren't much of a threat to adventurers, as a single stomp usually defeats them, although a number of powerful Goomba sub-species have emerged throughout the years. The Goombas, as a collective race, used to be allied with the Mushroom Kingdom. However, many of the Goombas have turned traitorous and joined the Koopa Troop, an organization led by Bowser. While a vast majority of Goombas allied themselves with the Koopa king, others became independent thieves, or even formed peaceful Goomba communities.

The stories protagonist. Born and grew up in Saitama prefecture. A high school student who enjoys baseball more than textbooks. He was 'named' by Conrad when he mentioned to Yuri's mother how, where he comes from, Yuri means July. Early in the show, bullies make fun of Yuri's name by calling him ""Shibuya Yūri, Harajuku Fūri"" (advantage Shibuya, disadvantage Harajuku)—a reference to popular districts of Tokyo. In the English dub, this becomes a pun on ""Yuri is short for urine.""

When Yuri arrives in Shin Makoku, he is declared the 27th Maoh of the Mazoku (""Demon Race""). Yuri easily gets caught up in his emotions to the point of losing control of himself. He is a little bit quick to anger, and once he's on a rampage he can't even stop himself. A music teacher he once had dubbed his rants ""the Turkish march."" When he is angry or sad or has a strong emotion his natural powers emerge. Yuri uses expressions from historical dramas when he gets this way, which probably has to do with the fact that he loves historical dramas. They call this condition is sometimes called ""Maou mode"" (「上様モード」 in Japanese, ""emperor mode""). In the anime this form can be recognized mainly by the longer hair and demon eyes. He can summon powerful magic (majutsu), even in the human territories (a notable feat as most Mazoku cannot perform magic outside their country), and even more remarkable he can use majutsu in souseki filled areas such as the souseki mines where other mazoku have difficulty standing and even breathing. Yuri's magic is manifested in various shapes—usually one or more great water dragons, or some messy magical ""creature"" made from mud, food morsels etc. After spending time in this form, Yuri becomes worn out and in some cases passes out and doesn't remember what happened afterwards. Later, Yuri learns to control his power and uses it to close the first of the Forbidden Boxes. In the beginning of season 1, he often fainted after he used Maryokou (especially in Human land) due to exhaustion. But later on he was able to maintain his consciousness after returning to his ""former self.""

Yuri has many allies and friends. His closest allies are Wolfram, Conrad, Günter, Gwendal, Murata, and Josak. They help Yuri throughout the series. At his first encounter with Wolfram von Bielefeld he ends up engaged to him due to a mishap: Wolfram, angry that Yuri has been chosen as the Maoh, makes the mistake of insulting Yuri's mother—which earns him a slap. Slapping another noble on his or her left cheek is the way in which Mazoku propose marriage (some consider the slap as unmanly, but Yuri explains in the light novel that he only slapped Wolfram because he has a beautiful face, otherwise he would have punched him). Incensed by this insult, Wolfram challenges Yuri to a duel, which is also mistakenly accepted because of Yuri's unfamiliarity with Mazoku custom (he picked up the knife that fell off the table).



Throughout the series, his main goal is to create a world in which Mazoku and humans can live together in peace, something that progresses slowly but surely as the series goes on.

Wolfram is a mazoku man who finds himself engaged to Yuuri after a cultural mistake. He is a ""bishounen,"" which means a pretty or beautiful boy. He is quite androgynous looking, with a notably beautiful face, shoulder-length hair and long eyelashes. His appearance is so influential, that several dying people in the hospital have a miraculous recovery after laying eyes on him. Wolfram possesses fire magic, as well as being adept with a sword. He is the half-brother of Conrad and Gwendal. He has extremely high pride as a demon and is hot-headed. He is arrogant and short-tempered but can also show a compassionate side at times. He is the only one of the previous queen's three sons who inherited her emerald green eyes and blonde hair, bearing a striking resemblance to her. In his mother's words, it seems he inherited his looks from her but his temperamental personality from his late father. Wolfram is obsessed with Yuuri and insists on following him everywhere as he claims it is his duty to protect his fiancé, though he also seems to want to prevent him from cheating on him. His ancestor, Rufus Bielefield, fought alongside the Original King (the great one).

Near the end of the second season, there is a time when Wolfram is possessed by Original King, who in turned was possessed by Soushu. The key he possesses, his heart, is ripped out by Original King in order to open one of the four boxes, ""Hellfire in Frozen Land"" (""Hellfire on Frozen Tundra"" in Japanese translation). Because of this, Wolfram temporarily dies, but is revived when the Original King returns the keys to their owners.

Wolfram is the youngest son of the former Maou, Cecilie von Spitzweig. He initially dislikes humans, even Conrad's father. Because of his mazoku pride, he does not like to admit that Conrad is his brother, even though he cares for Conrad (Wolfram always referred to Conrad by his last name—Lord Weller; however, after Conrad's return from his supposed betrayal, Wolfram refers to Conrad by his first name). In the graphic novels, it is hinted that this hatred towards humans stems from his late father's prejudice against humans. His liking for humans improves throughout the series, progressing to the point that he adopts the human girl Greta as his daughter, starts acknowledging Yuuri's parents as his future ""in-laws"" and also runs into a raging fire to save a human child.

Years ago when he was a child, Wolfram accidentally slapped Elizabeth, Raven's niece, on her left cheek. Elizabeth never forgot this incident, insisting that they swore everlasting love that day, while Wolfram insists he forgot why he slapped her in the first place. Some time after collecting three of the Four Forbidden Boxes, Elizabeth becomes Stoffel's tool to separate Yuuri from the three brothers, pronouncing an engagement proposal to Yuuri. Elizabeth's real goal is to marry Wolfram, but Wolfram says that his only fiance is Yuuri. During the duel which ensues, (as Yuuri accidentally picked up a knife and a fork pointing it at Elizabeth; symbolizing a fight to settle a triangle love affair), Yuuri turns into the Maou, protecting Wolfram from being hurt by fire majutsu that Elizabeth summoned. He proclaims the two go on the date and remember their childhood memories. It is eventually learned that Wolfram slapped Elizabeth because he wanted to touch a butterfly that flew past, and Conrad was watching the entire event.

Wolfram is an extremely ""pretty"" person—Yuuri calls him this upon first meeting him (specifically using the term ""bishōnen"" in the Japanese version and very often in the light novel). This is also why Yuuri slapped Wolfram when he badmouthed Yuuri's mother instead of punching him, stating that it's a pity to dirty such a pretty face (Source: the novels). This image is enhanced by his choice of nightwear—a frilly nightgown that contrasts violently with his rather quick temper.

When he first becomes engaged to Yuuri, he is extremely upset, but the idea quickly grows on him. He takes the engagement much more seriously than Yuuri does. He follows Yuuri practically everywhere so he can keep an eye on him and even sneaks into Yuuri's bedroom at night. He gets extremely jealous when Yuuri talks to a girl or good-looking guy and often accuses him of being unfaithful which is sometimes used as comic relief, but as a character he is popular between fans and is considered to be the anime's breakout character. Even if he does not like to admit it, the series hints that Wolfram deeply cares about Yuuri. He tends to think Yuuri can be saved from bad situations because of his cuteness. By the end of the anime, he is making blatant declarations of love.

A major weakness is that he gets sea-sick. Yuuri also says that Wolfram cannot paint well, even though he insists on painting. It is revealed that Wolfram used to paint impressively realistic portraits of his family, but got bored of realism at some point and decided to adopt a more abstract art style, much to Yuuri's disappointment.

During the end of season two and the beginning of season three, Wolfram is chosen by the Ten Noble Families of Shin Makoku (Christ, Voltaire, Grantz, Bielefeld, Karbelnikoff, Wincott, Spitzberg, Gyllenhaal, Rochefort, and Radford) to become the next Maou, due to the belief that Yuuri would not be able to return to Shin Makoku at the time. When Yuuri does in fact return, Wolfram's uncle, Waltorana, places pressure on Wolfram to obtain the throne. Because of this, Wolfram dissolves the engagement with Yuuri and travels back to his homelands, in hopes that he would not be used to sabotage Yuuri.

Discovering of Wolfram's predicament, Yuuri and his retainers travel to the Bielefeld lands in the hopes of persuading Wolfram to return to Blood Pledge Castle, only to be forced into a formal duel by Wolfram himself. The battle becomes quite intense, as Wolfram gives his all against Yuuri and Yuuri trying his best to persuade Wolfram to stop the duel. At the climax, Yuuri was forced to protect himself by becoming the Maou and, angered by Wolfram's reckless dueling, prepares to hit Wolfram with a potentially fatal attack. In the process of hitting Wolfram with the attack, Yuuri watched as Wolfram prepared himself for what seems to be his last moment and gave his final words to Yuuri: ""Yuuri. Be a good king."" Realizing that Wolfram had planned the whole thing from the beginning so Yuuri could remain the Maou, Yuuri absorbed the attack onto himself at the last moment, sparring Wolfram of the damage. The Ten Noble Families then changed their decision to keep Yuuri as their king and Waltorana steps down from forcing Wolfram onto the throne. After a reconciliation between the two, Wolfram happily decides to annul the disengagement to a comically shocked Yuuri and proceeds to return to his normal attitude towards their engagement.

During the course of the series, Wolfram has grown exponentially from a spoiled prince to a selfless young man who stands by Yuuri with no question. Though, he had no plans of becoming Maou in the first place, he was willing to protect and serve Shin Makoku when it was resolved that Yuuri would not be returning back at the end of the second season, wanting to protect the beautiful job Yuuri did as Maou.

A teacher and swordsman who adores Yuuri. Günter is a skilled swordsman and magician but has retired to teach Yuuri about Shin Makoku and his future duties as the Maou. Günter once stated that he was the one who taught Conrad to ""become His Majesty's sword and shield"" indicating that perhaps Günter was once Conrad's teacher. When Günter accidentally travels to Earth, he becomes a model in New York City for a brief period of time so that he can earn money to find Yuuri. He is a very whimsical person and poetic in his thoughts. Günter is another test subject of Anissina.

Günter, along with the three brothers, helps Yuuri run the country. He is Yuuri's adviser and mentor, teaching him about various aspects of Shin Makoku. He usually spends his time doing numerous duties for both Yuuri and Shin Makoku.

When Günter was shot with a poisoned arrow containing the Wincott poison, his soul was temporarily housed in an Okiku Doll that flies, shoots lasers from its eyes, and has hair that grows naturally. During this time his body was known as Snow Günter and could be controlled by or released from the effects of the Wincott poison by anyone of the Von Wincott bloodline, like Julia's father and nephew.

Günter's personality is usually that of a good nature, but when he puts on his serious face he can be awe-inspiring. He has an extremely strong attachment to Yuuri and tends to pine when Yuuri has been gone from Shin Makoku for any considerable amount of time. He is very popular among women and men because of his good looks.

Günter's political views make a radical change due to Yuuri's influence. In the beginning, he was the one pushing most strongly for the war that would exterminate the human race. As the series goes on Yuuri's views are impressed upon him, and he begins to truly believe in and work for a peaceful alliance between Mazoku and humans.

Günter's only family seems to be his adopted daughter Gisela.

From the beginning, Gwendal has objections to Yuri becoming the Maoh. He is a skilled tactician and is capable of using earth magic and can cast barriers. When not otherwise busy, Gwendal indulges in his hobby of knitting and sewing but often his creatures look nothing like what they're supposed to (for example a bear got mistaken for a black pig or a cat that looks like a raccoon). He is adamnant that knitting helps him sharpen his concentration but actually its a stress reliever for him since childhood. He is also quite fond of cute animals or cute objects such as the dolphin keychain (Bandou-kun) Yuri received at the dolphin show and later gave to him. His childhood best friend is Anissina von Karbelnikoff, an inventor who often tests out her inventions on him, much to his displeasure. Anissina is also the one who taught Gwendal how to knit. Gwendal's left eye is a key to one of the four Forbidden Boxes, the ""End of the Earth"".

Gwendal is a tough guy except when it comes to his childhood friend, Anissina, and his brothers. He is afraid of Anissina and often hides from her so he can prevent being used in one of her crazy experiments. He is even seen sweating in panic at the thought of her. While he does not outwardly show much affection towards his brothers, he shows in times of great stress that he does care, an example being his decision to stand against the Original King to save his little brother, Wolfram. Jozak, who was sent to locate one of the Four Forbidden Boxes, tells Conrad that Gwendal really cares for Conrad's wellbeing and doesn't want Conrad to worry despite the Original King's wishes for Conrad to find the Boxes. His ancestor, Siegbert Voltaire, fought along the Original King.

When he was younger, Gwendal despised humans, a habit called the Mazoku Pride by Dunheely Weller. On Dunheely's last journey to a nameless village, he told Gwendal to enjoy the ride before their last duel. Upon arriving in the village, Gwendal is shocked that the village isn't recognized by Shin Makoku, and leads the attack on the bandits which targeted the village. In this duel, Gwendal sees Dunheely for who he really was, an old man, not the agile man he knew when he was younger. Dunheely later dies of old age, and Gwendal buries him near the tree where Dunheely told Gwendal what he was looking for. Years later while on a picnic with his family and Yuri, Gwendal admits that Dunheely was a larger existence than anyone else within him, because he hated that man.

Gwendal has no interest in love affairs, and even points out that issues coming from love affairs are beyond his abilities to influence. He does occasionally show care towards Greta, often being in charge of her while Yuri and Wolfram are in one of their adventures. Gwendal knows how to bake, as he does so for Greta when Günter, who would usually bake cookies for Greta, leaves the castle for a short journey. Greta comments that Gwendal's cookies look cute while Yuri comments Gwendal is good at baking as Gwendal's cookies are made into animal shapes, similar to the ones he knits. When Greta asks Gwendal if she is disturbing him while he is doing work, Gwendal says ""Since it's you, I don't mind"".

He is the commander of the demon army and often comes with reinforcements when Yuri finds himself in big trouble. He is also the one who does the paperwork and essentially runs the kingdom for Yuri. Often enough, when Yuri leaves the castle, Gunter is seen barging into Gwendal's office, demanding where Yuri is. Gwendal would usually look tired and suggest an idea which sounds appealing to Gunter, for example locking Yuri up in a room where no one will interfere.

Conrad is a swordsman (""the best swordsman in Shin Makoku"" - according to Wolfram) who looks after Yuuri. He possesses no maryoku (demonic magic) due to his mixed heritage of human and mazoku. His given name is Conrart; Yuuri nicknames him ""Conrad,"" which is ""closer to English"" and easier to pronounce with a Japanese tongue. Conrad is the second child of the previous Maou, Cecilie von Spitzweig. His father was human (also considered the greatest swordsman in the Demon Kingdom; Dan Hiri Weller). His ancestor, Lawrence Weller, fought alongside the Original King during the war against Soushu. As Conrad's father was not a Mazoku noble, he doesn't have ""von"" in his name.

On his 16th birthday, he decided to live as a Mazoku instead of a human. He fought on the front lines for the Mazoku during a war against the humans. He and Yozak are the only two survivors of the Battle of Lütenburg, and at the request of Julia von Wincott, he was also put in charge of the soul that was to be the new Maoh. He transported it safely to Earth so that it could be born.

Furthermore, he was the one who was the inspiration for Yuuri's name. He stated that ""Where I come from, the month of July is called Yuuri"", which made Yuuri's mother name him 'Yuuri' because he was born in July. For this reason, Yuuri dubs him 'Nazukeoya', which is a person who names someone (Conrad is also known as Yuuri's Godfather by his mother). Cecilie named the blue flowers she grew ""Conrad Stands Upon Earth"".

When Yuuri first came to Shin Makoku, Conrad was the one to find him (after some humans and Adelbert) and bring him safely to the castle. He acts as Yuuri's bodyguard and vows to protect Yuri with his life. He was described by Yuri as almost perfect with fine looks and a mild demeanor but he makes the worst jokes. Typically, he could be found with an unassuming smile on his face, and persists in calling Yuuri 'Heika (Your Majesty)' except in dire situations, and when Yuuri scolds him for it.



He was also very close to Suzanna Julia von Wincott, whose soul now resides inside Yuuri.

Saito Hiraga, the main male character, is from Earth (specifically Tokyo, Japan). At the time of the summoning, he had just picked up his laptop after attempting to get it repaired in Akihabara. A portal of some kind opened in front of him; and Saito's curiosity getting the better of him, he touched it and was sucked through. At first, Saito had no idea where he was, and was thoroughly disoriented. When he arrives on the other side however he is made to sit and obey like a normal household dog. When the bond of him being her familiar, involves having a kiss with the familiar, he is quite shocked at why they do it. In the anime, he also could not identify nor understand the language the students were speaking, but after Louise attempts to cast a silence spell on him that fails, he could understand and communicate with others as though they were speaking Japanese. It is not clear whether he was actually gifted with full knowledge of their language, or whether the misfired spell was similar in principle to a universal translator. This was not the case in the light novel though, where he does understand their language; like the names of the characters, the language spoken by them is also French.

There are Runes inscribed into Saito's hand as a result of his being bound to Louise. They read geboundolf or Gundolf meaning Gandálfr (ガンダールヴ, Gandāruvu?). These runes glow when his Gandálfr powers activate. As a Gandálfr, Saito has the ability to use any object that was made with the intent of being used as a weapon at an extremely high level of skill. He also becomes significantly stronger, faster and tougher. Even weapons that he had never touched before, such as an M-72 rocket launcher and a World War II Zero Fighter, can be instantly understood and utilized. This physical augmentation fades more or less instantly when he stops using the power, which can result in him falling unconscious if he'd been wounded previously. That he can only use items specifically crafted for the purpose of weapons was revealed by Derflinger after a failed attempt to use an ornamental sword. It has not been made clear whether Gandálfr powers could be used in conjunction with purely magical weaponry such as a wand or a staff. Even with these abilities he doesn't defend himself at all against Louise's constant beatings.

The series constantly implies him being a pervert and sometimes he does think exactly like one, but justifiably, he is a young single guy who isn't married to anyone. Louise just enforces an ownership type arrangement over Saito implying she is owed Saito's feelings. It is later revealed that Saito has feelings for Louise and even says it openly to her.

Saito also has a bit of a troublesome and somewhat complicated tendency of getting involved with women. Strange and oddly sexual things happen when he seemingly becomes intimate with another girl. A few examples are when Kirche or even Siesta try to gain his attention, by mostly sexual seduction. When he meets or speaks to an attractive girl, he is often only noticing her chest in a few instances . This is actually one of the main reasons why Louise treats him so poorly as he is expected to be perfect in every way in her childish mindset.

Although he acts a bit perverted at times, this does not mean that he does not think of Louise. Similar to how she feels whenever he is becoming intimate with another girl (specifically with large breasts) Saito can get very upset when it comes to Louise and other men. He dislikes Julio for his ""snobbish"" interest in Louise, especially since he is adored by all the other young girls in Tristain Academy. He becomes extremely jealous and calls him a bastard whenever he tries to touch Louise or gain her attention. He also becomes upset he hears of Louise being married off to someone else. When his friends dragged him into a hole to peep at the girls while they were bathing, he was extremely protective of Louise and stopped them before they saw her naked.He uses the name ""My Louise"" several times in the light novels when he feels jealous toward other guys. This is definite evidence of his strong feelings for Louise.

His partner, the talking sword Derflinger, was also the partner of the Gandálfr from six-thousand years ago. His advice and comments never reflect well on Saito. Saito protects Louise because he is her familiar, and it is later shown that he has feelings for her as well, claiming ""All that he is good at is protecting her."" He is revealed to be a Gandálfr, a familiar who exists to protect a Void Wizard as they cast their spells. Even when this fact becomes known to Louise, she still physically assaults him, while Saito is seen often shrugging it off as his fault. Saito was given the nickname ""Our Sword"" by the head cook in episode three, where Louise takes Saito into town to purchase a weapon for him, which happens to be the legendary sword Derflinger. By the beginning of the third series, the magical runes on Saito's hand mysteriously disappear, and Saito's position of Gandálfr is in question. He regains them when he is re-summoned by Louise. With the return of runes, Saito is knighted for the feat of stopping an entire army by himself, and given a hero's welcome at the Academy. Saito is named after Gennai Hiraga who is an Edo period Japanese scientist, and his name is written as ""ability man.""",Main,"Hino, Satoshi",Japanese,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/62832.jpg?s=25d1f3f058ad0e1cf56615b5130ca712

Louise Françoise Le Blanc de La Vallière is the main female character. She is a second year student at the Tristain Academy of Magic and a terrible mage who is often scorned by her fellow classmates. Because every spell she casts fails, she is nicknamed ""Louise the Zero"" after her zero percent success rate. She is the third daughter of the noble family La Vallière who owns the north-eastern territory of Tristain. Even though it takes her a long time to admit it, she quickly falls in love with the familiar she summons, a human by the name of Saito.

Even though her feelings on mages is known, she doesn't do anything to defend Saito due to misunderstandings by Louise that happen in front of her. Agnes often emphasized that mages should not become dependent of their magic, because in battles, there will be no time to cast spells before the enemy's swords and guns. At one point she kisses Louise to provide cover when Louise gasps while the two of them are eavesdropping on a pair of conspirators. The kiss she gave Louise and the commentary Siesta made about her implies Agnès is a lesbian, although she is most portrayed as being uninterested in sexual pursuits and only worried about fighting and revenge. She first appears in the second season. In the third season, upon finding Colbert was alive, she gives up her want for vengeance, deciding to end the hatred so his students wouldn't hate her for killing him.

In the light novels, after Saito confronted the advancing Albion army(Volume 7:Chapter 9) and then saved by Tiffania(VOlume 8), she was asked by Henrietta to find Saito and then found him in Tiffania's village, though Saito having lost his Gandalfr powers and said he is now useless and just a normal person and asked her to tell the Queen that he's already dead. She then trains Saito and even comments to Derflinger that Saito had made her serious when they had a spar.

Weapon: Delflinger (デルフリンガー), a sentient sword

Saito Hiraga, the main male character, is from Earth (specifically Tokyo, Japan). At the time of the summoning, he had just picked up his laptop after attempting to get it repaired in Akihabara. A portal of some kind opened in front of him; and Saito's curiosity getting the better of him, he touched it and was sucked through. At first, Saito had no idea where he was, and was thoroughly disoriented. When he arrives on the other side however he is made to sit and obey like a normal household dog. When the bond of him being her familiar, involves having a kiss with the familiar, he is quite shocked at why they do it. In the anime, he also could not identify nor understand the language the students were speaking, but after Louise attempts to cast a silence spell on him that fails, he could understand and communicate with others as though they were speaking Japanese. It is not clear whether he was actually gifted with full knowledge of their language, or whether the misfired spell was similar in principle to a universal translator. This was not the case in the light novel though, where he does understand their language; like the names of the characters, the language spoken by them is also French.

There are Runes inscribed into Saito's hand as a result of his being bound to Louise. They read geboundolf or Gundolf meaning Gandálfr (ガンダールヴ, Gandāruvu?). These runes glow when his Gandálfr powers activate. As a Gandálfr, Saito has the ability to use any object that was made with the intent of being used as a weapon at an extremely high level of skill. He also becomes significantly stronger, faster and tougher. Even weapons that he had never touched before, such as an M-72 rocket launcher and a World War II Zero Fighter, can be instantly understood and utilized. This physical augmentation fades more or less instantly when he stops using the power, which can result in him falling unconscious if he'd been wounded previously. That he can only use items specifically crafted for the purpose of weapons was revealed by Derflinger after a failed attempt to use an ornamental sword. It has not been made clear whether Gandálfr powers could be used in conjunction with purely magical weaponry such as a wand or a staff. Even with these abilities he doesn't defend himself at all against Louise's constant beatings.

The series constantly implies him being a pervert and sometimes he does think exactly like one, but justifiably, he is a young single guy who isn't married to anyone. Louise just enforces an ownership type arrangement over Saito implying she is owed Saito's feelings. It is later revealed that Saito has feelings for Louise and even says it openly to her.

Saito also has a bit of a troublesome and somewhat complicated tendency of getting involved with women. Strange and oddly sexual things happen when he seemingly becomes intimate with another girl. A few examples are when Kirche or even Siesta try to gain his attention, by mostly sexual seduction. When he meets or speaks to an attractive girl, he is often only noticing her chest in a few instances . This is actually one of the main reasons why Louise treats him so poorly as he is expected to be perfect in every way in her childish mindset.

Although he acts a bit perverted at times, this does not mean that he does not think of Louise. Similar to how she feels whenever he is becoming intimate with another girl (specifically with large breasts) Saito can get very upset when it comes to Louise and other men. He dislikes Julio for his ""snobbish"" interest in Louise, especially since he is adored by all the other young girls in Tristain Academy. He becomes extremely jealous and calls him a bastard whenever he tries to touch Louise or gain her attention. He also becomes upset he hears of Louise being married off to someone else. When his friends dragged him into a hole to peep at the girls while they were bathing, he was extremely protective of Louise and stopped them before they saw her naked.He uses the name ""My Louise"" several times in the light novels when he feels jealous toward other guys. This is definite evidence of his strong feelings for Louise.

His partner, the talking sword Derflinger, was also the partner of the Gandálfr from six-thousand years ago. His advice and comments never reflect well on Saito. Saito protects Louise because he is her familiar, and it is later shown that he has feelings for her as well, claiming ""All that he is good at is protecting her."" He is revealed to be a Gandálfr, a familiar who exists to protect a Void Wizard as they cast their spells. Even when this fact becomes known to Louise, she still physically assaults him, while Saito is seen often shrugging it off as his fault. Saito was given the nickname ""Our Sword"" by the head cook in episode three, where Louise takes Saito into town to purchase a weapon for him, which happens to be the legendary sword Derflinger. By the beginning of the third series, the magical runes on Saito's hand mysteriously disappear, and Saito's position of Gandálfr is in question. He regains them when he is re-summoned by Louise. With the return of runes, Saito is knighted for the feat of stopping an entire army by himself, and given a hero's welcome at the Academy. Saito is named after Gennai Hiraga who is an Edo period Japanese scientist, and his name is written as ""ability man.""",Main,"Hino, Satoshi",Japanese,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/62832.jpg?s=25d1f3f058ad0e1cf56615b5130ca712

Louise Françoise Le Blanc de La Vallière is the main female character. She is a second year student at the Tristain Academy of Magic and a terrible mage who is often scorned by her fellow classmates. Because every spell she casts fails, she is nicknamed ""Louise the Zero"" after her zero percent success rate. She is the third daughter of the noble family La Vallière who owns the north-eastern territory of Tristain. Even though it takes her a long time to admit it, she quickly falls in love with the familiar she summons, a human by the name of Saito.

He initially opposes Nozomi's wish to fight, believing that women should not be exposed to the dangers of the battlefield, but readily accepts her when she can prove herself in battle. He is easily misjudged due to his blunt way of speaking, but in fact he takes very good care of his men and of other people.

She accidentally saves the life of Princess Mil when her house falls on Mil's would-be murderer (much as in the The Wonderful Wizard of Oz) upon falling into the fantasy world. After that she becomes extremely protective of Mill, who often shows intimate feelings or sexual advances toward Maze. She is a natural pacifist when the story begins. She has considerable magical ability but initially is much less effective at using them while a female. Maze is a fusion of Mei and her brother Akira who switch places at daybreak and nightfall. During the day Mei is dominant, while at night Akira is. Maze was brought from the real world as the Eraser to correct an imbalance.

At night Maze turns into a male with a distinct personality from the daytime female form. He loves to fight, to the horror of the female form, who can be seen trapped in his head shouting at him wherever he tries to fight. In male form he has vastly increased magical powers. He is very sexually predatory towards almost any pretty girl he meets. Like the female Maze, his memories are mostly wiped or jumbled upon leaving the real world, though they start to recover over time. He is initially portrayed as a sex crazed, violent monster with little personality, but in time his personality emerges.The Japanese character for ""Akira"" can also be read as ""Mei"" and thus the name ""Maze"" comes from the term ""Meis"" as in ""two Meis"".

For most of her life, Rapier tried to convince others (And herself) that she was not a woman. Her father wanted a son so badly that when Rapier was born, he started telling her she was a man and cut her hair very short. It was only when the king accidentally walked in on her she was discovered to be a woman. It is hinted that Rapier showed intimate feelings for the king, going into deep remorse when the king was killed during a raid from Jaina. However, it is very likely Rapier is attracted to Man Maze, mentioning she would let him make a move on her after the Creator was finally defeated. It is also shown in the final episode credits Man Maze holding a partially undressed Rapier. Rapier is a master of the sword, able to cut down smaller Demi Armor with relative ease.

In episode ten, she gets into a fight with a woman from her old dojo named ""Lightning Rod"" Medusa, and it is somewhat clear that they were old lovers until Medusa killed the master and then tried to kill Solude. During their final battle, Medusa purposely wasted her last crossbow bolt so that Solude could kill her, the reason being her lust for power had ruined the life she could have had and the life that the two of them could have had together.

She is obsessed with both Mazes and often outlines her plans to marry Maze (but always with the female one), have Maze's children (with the male one), etcetera. Her family was killed when the Jaina holy group took over her family's territory. She also has the power to summon Dulgar, one of the greatest Demi-Armors (equivalent of a mech) in the entire world, which only Maze has the power to pilot. In the manga 'she' is actually a hermaphrodite.

Later, in the temple of the Digimon Temple, the legendary Digimon Deckerdramon chose Kiriha as his general over Taiki and Nene, stating that Kiriha held the strongest love in his heart, shocking Kiriha. 

As the series goes on, Kiriha and Taiki became occasional allies and enemies. Whereas Taiki valued trust, friendship, and believed in all Digimon, Kiriha valued power and believed only in strong Digimon. These two values would clash multiple times through the season as Kiriha refused to help weak Digimon.

Weapon: Delflinger (デルフリンガー), a sentient sword

Saito Hiraga, the main male character, is from Earth (specifically Tokyo, Japan). At the time of the summoning, he had just picked up his laptop after attempting to get it repaired in Akihabara. A portal of some kind opened in front of him; and Saito's curiosity getting the better of him, he touched it and was sucked through. At first, Saito had no idea where he was, and was thoroughly disoriented. When he arrives on the other side however he is made to sit and obey like a normal household dog. When the bond of him being her familiar, involves having a kiss with the familiar, he is quite shocked at why they do it. In the anime, he also could not identify nor understand the language the students were speaking, but after Louise attempts to cast a silence spell on him that fails, he could understand and communicate with others as though they were speaking Japanese. It is not clear whether he was actually gifted with full knowledge of their language, or whether the misfired spell was similar in principle to a universal translator. This was not the case in the light novel though, where he does understand their language; like the names of the characters, the language spoken by them is also French.

There are Runes inscribed into Saito's hand as a result of his being bound to Louise. They read geboundolf or Gundolf meaning Gandálfr (ガンダールヴ, Gandāruvu?). These runes glow when his Gandálfr powers activate. As a Gandálfr, Saito has the ability to use any object that was made with the intent of being used as a weapon at an extremely high level of skill. He also becomes significantly stronger, faster and tougher. Even weapons that he had never touched before, such as an M-72 rocket launcher and a World War II Zero Fighter, can be instantly understood and utilized. This physical augmentation fades more or less instantly when he stops using the power, which can result in him falling unconscious if he'd been wounded previously. That he can only use items specifically crafted for the purpose of weapons was revealed by Derflinger after a failed attempt to use an ornamental sword. It has not been made clear whether Gandálfr powers could be used in conjunction with purely magical weaponry such as a wand or a staff. Even with these abilities he doesn't defend himself at all against Louise's constant beatings.

The series constantly implies him being a pervert and sometimes he does think exactly like one, but justifiably, he is a young single guy who isn't married to anyone. Louise just enforces an ownership type arrangement over Saito implying she is owed Saito's feelings. It is later revealed that Saito has feelings for Louise and even says it openly to her.

Saito also has a bit of a troublesome and somewhat complicated tendency of getting involved with women. Strange and oddly sexual things happen when he seemingly becomes intimate with another girl. A few examples are when Kirche or even Siesta try to gain his attention, by mostly sexual seduction. When he meets or speaks to an attractive girl, he is often only noticing her chest in a few instances . This is actually one of the main reasons why Louise treats him so poorly as he is expected to be perfect in every way in her childish mindset.

Although he acts a bit perverted at times, this does not mean that he does not think of Louise. Similar to how she feels whenever he is becoming intimate with another girl (specifically with large breasts) Saito can get very upset when it comes to Louise and other men. He dislikes Julio for his ""snobbish"" interest in Louise, especially since he is adored by all the other young girls in Tristain Academy. He becomes extremely jealous and calls him a bastard whenever he tries to touch Louise or gain her attention. He also becomes upset he hears of Louise being married off to someone else. When his friends dragged him into a hole to peep at the girls while they were bathing, he was extremely protective of Louise and stopped them before they saw her naked.He uses the name ""My Louise"" several times in the light novels when he feels jealous toward other guys. This is definite evidence of his strong feelings for Louise.

His partner, the talking sword Derflinger, was also the partner of the Gandálfr from six-thousand years ago. His advice and comments never reflect well on Saito. Saito protects Louise because he is her familiar, and it is later shown that he has feelings for her as well, claiming ""All that he is good at is protecting her."" He is revealed to be a Gandálfr, a familiar who exists to protect a Void Wizard as they cast their spells. Even when this fact becomes known to Louise, she still physically assaults him, while Saito is seen often shrugging it off as his fault. Saito was given the nickname ""Our Sword"" by the head cook in episode three, where Louise takes Saito into town to purchase a weapon for him, which happens to be the legendary sword Derflinger. By the beginning of the third series, the magical runes on Saito's hand mysteriously disappear, and Saito's position of Gandálfr is in question. He regains them when he is re-summoned by Louise. With the return of runes, Saito is knighted for the feat of stopping an entire army by himself, and given a hero's welcome at the Academy. Saito is named after Gennai Hiraga who is an Edo period Japanese scientist, and his name is written as ""ability man.""",Main,"Hino, Satoshi",Japanese,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/62832.jpg?s=25d1f3f058ad0e1cf56615b5130ca712

Runic Name: Louise the Zero (Zero no Louise)

Louise Françoise Le Blanc de La Vallière is the main female character. She is a second year student at the Tristain Academy of Magic and a terrible mage who is often scorned by her fellow classmates. Because every spell she casts fails, she is nicknamed ""Louise the Zero"" after her zero percent success rate. She is the third daughter of the noble family La Vallière who owns the north-eastern territory of Tristain. Even though it takes her a long time to admit it, she quickly falls in love with the familiar she summons, a human by the name of Saito.

Even though her feelings on mages is known, she doesn't do anything to defend Saito due to misunderstandings by Louise that happen in front of her. Agnes often emphasized that mages should not become dependent of their magic, because in battles, there will be no time to cast spells before the enemy's swords and guns. At one point she kisses Louise to provide cover when Louise gasps while the two of them are eavesdropping on a pair of conspirators. The kiss she gave Louise and the commentary Siesta made about her implies Agnès is a lesbian, although she is most portrayed as being uninterested in sexual pursuits and only worried about fighting and revenge. She first appears in the second season. In the third season, upon finding Colbert was alive, she gives up her want for vengeance, deciding to end the hatred so his students wouldn't hate her for killing him.

In the light novels, after Saito confronted the advancing Albion army(Volume 7:Chapter 9) and then saved by Tiffania(VOlume 8), she was asked by Henrietta to find Saito and then found him in Tiffania's village, though Saito having lost his Gandalfr powers and said he is now useless and just a normal person and asked her to tell the Queen that he's already dead. She then trains Saito and even comments to Derflinger that Saito had made her serious when they had a spar.

After a while he formed strong bonds of friendship and with the others, and although he and Tiger still argued frequently, they too developed a sense of friendship. While friendly, Hare tends to be selfish and gloats about his skills. His fighting style revolves around boxing, flying kicks and flatulence (removed from the U.S. version). Although he was often reminded of his shifty past by his teammates (particularly Tiger), Hare became the team planner and often devised cunning battle strategies, rescue operations and even methods of retreat when necessary.

Born in Konohagakure, a ninja village hidden in the leaves, Naruto Uzumaki was destined for greatness. When born, a powerful nine-tailed demon fox attacked his village. With a wave of its tail, the demon fox could raise tsunamis and shatter mountains. In a valiant attempt to save the village from destruction, the Fourth Hokage, the leader of the Hidden Leaf Village, sealed the demon fox within Naruto's newborn body. This was his final act, for the battle with the fox cost him his life.

Despite the Fourth Hokage's dying wish that Naruto be viewed as a hero for serving as the container for the demon (a Jinchuuriki) the adult villagers of Konoha harbored a fierce hatred for him, with many believing that Naruto and the demon were one and the same. Cast aside as an inhuman monster, Naruto was outcast and ostracized by the villagers for reasons he could not understand. The children his age could only ever follow their parents' example; and they too came to harbor a fierce hatred for Naruto.

Naruto eventually came to accept that he would live and die alone, and his external response was to perform harmless pranks on the village. Boisterous, raffish and full of life, Naruto soon came to display a somewhat unexpected determination to succeed and be accepted by others. Upon being assigned to ""Team Seven"" as a Genin-ranked ninja, his true potential soon became outwardly apparent.

Vowing to become Hokage one day and using his will to never give in, Naruto saves the village from invading forces and earns his acceptance. Eventually, Naruto learns to harness the power of the Demon Fox sealed inside him to perform acts of strength far beyond what any other human is capable of.

Shino Aburame is character who has a fascination with bugs; most of his spare time is spent watching bugs, he often makes analogies to bugs when talking. In addition to liking bugs, Shino is characterized by his emotionless, solitary, and collected way of doing things. He speaks very bluntly and never allows emotion to interfere with his judgment, sometimes offending people in doing so. Despite his odd personality and occasionally arguing with Kiba, Shino has a very strong sense of connection with his teammates and allies.

Shino alongside Hinata Hyuga and Kiba Inuzuka is in team 8 which is led by Kurenai Yuuhi.

In battle, Shino is able to take great use of his intelligence, being able to use his analytical and observational skills to make shrewd judgments with pinpoint reasoning. As a member of the Aburame clan, Shino was infused at birth with a special breed of insects that feed on chakra. In return for becoming a living hive, the insects attack opponents, usually while he distracts them, and carry out other tasks as he commands. Shino has found a number of uses for these bugs, and as such has devised a number of jutsu that utilize them for varying purposes, such as creating copies of himself or using bugs for defensive purposes.",Supporting,"Prince, Derek Stephen, Kawada, Shinji, Crépet, Alexandre, Zanandrea, Federico, Harloff, Fabian, Araújo, Márcio, Flores, Óscar","English, Japanese, French, Italian, German, Portuguese (BR), Spanish","https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/41281.jpg?s=9cdd7f3211e68f90b3f2dfa9958585e1, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/80128.jpg?s=0f87fd03d034c7adc20e1e6e09526bd6, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/71248.jpg?s=e7e3eb3f011298a0c655dc30f2a4e85a, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/65118.jpg?s=1276e1d4e14a671d299dafac28b91ede, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/26629.jpg?s=0ab28b1a1bf0d0188fbf4a2641e71b0b, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/65998.jpg?s=2e7f1148a0f5055c18264c877285fa3f, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/69909.jpg?s=961a81d9d01cfe155092dbc10bf35db4"

Together they were the previous Ino-Shika-Chou trio.

During the Nine-Tails' Attack on Konoha, Chouza and his teammates assisted in the village's defense. A few years later, Chouza learned that Chouji was treated as an outcast because of his weight and the belief that Akimichi were useless ninja. Chouza told him that one day, he would have true friends that would realize that wasn't the true Chouji. Chouza is the head of the Akimichi clan, and was part of the first ""Ino-Shika-Chou Trio"" alongside Shikaku Nara and Inoichi Yamanaka, his name being the Chou part of the group name.

He is a gentle and caring man with seemingly great wisdom and understanding of the world, and has deep love for his son, Chouji. Like the rest of his clan, he has a large appetite, and is prone to eat everything on an entire page on the menu.
Like his son and the rest of his clan, Chouza uses the special technique that allows him to change calories into chakra. As the leader of his clan, it is highly logical that he is skilled in all of his clan's secret techniques. He has been seen using the Multi-Size Technique, the Human Bullet Tank and the Partial Multi-Size Technique, which all revolve around the clan's special ability to increase the size of their various body parts.

Zodiac: Taurus 
Occupation: Akatsuki member 

Deidara is a missing-nin from Iwagakure. Before joining Akatsuki, Deidara was as a terrorist bomber for hire, where his work attracted the attention of Pain. Pain sent other Akatsuki members to recruit Deidara, though he refused. After being defeated by Itachi Uchiha, however, Deidara was forced to join the organization. Deidara maintained a deep loathing for Itachi from that point further and became determined to defeat him, even training one of his eyes to overcome Itachi's signature ability: genjutsu. Deidara was partnered with Sasori upon joining the organization, whose artistic ability and insight Deidara admired. After Sasori's death Deidara is paired with Tobi whom he treats as a disciple. Despite Tobi's habit of accidentally angering Deidara, Deidara takes great care to keep Tobi out of harm's way and even dedicates his final moments to apologizing to him.

In battle, Deidara uses special mouths in the palm of each hand to create Exploding Clay, chakra-infused clay that explodes on command. He commonly uses the command ""Katsu"" to trigger it. The blast strength of his creations is determined by how much chakra he adds to them. His clay can take on any size or form, ranging from microscopic in size to copies of himself as tall as a skyscraper. Deidara refers to his creations as art, believing the most beautiful thing about them to be their detonation. His admiration for his art is such that he believes it can't be defeated, leading to overconfidence in battle. Depending on the complexity or potency of one of his works, Deidara applies it a designation from anywhere between ""C1"" to ""C4"", the former being the most basic and the latter being his strongest and most complex attack. For his final act, Deidara also has a mouth on his chest that, once provided with clay, turns him into a living bomb that destroys everything in a 10 kilometer radius.",Supporting,"Kawamoto, Katsuhiko, Smith, Roger Craig, Bendjilali, Valéry, Sandri, Luca, Gama, Lucas, Chi, Enrique","Japanese, English, French, Italian, Portuguese (BR), Spanish","https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/7331.jpg?s=b962a44c4abe02ad16350ebeec16d9b8, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/39050.jpg?s=6c1d9b76787b13402a26a7d3a2e3c2a1, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/68464.jpg?s=3f28b30cfcee49415f0811234b2779a6, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/9075.jpg?s=c24a4869af2b93e464cfd613734879f7, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/79735.jpg?s=f0c97a1d03a2439c1836e8cff75dbc73, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/82246.jpg?s=edc372c5b8a4927d6e0b04f513ff3cc0"

He is also from present day Japan, and ran track in middle school. His name Arata uses the kanji used in revolution.

Arata Hinohara is first introduced in chapter 2 of volume 1 getting ready for school and he is looking forward to the fact that he gets to start fresh in high school due to being bullied in middle school. On his way to school he catches a pervert in the act, and as he flees, Arata chases him down and tackles him until the police arrive. Because of that incident he meets his first friend in high school by the name Suguru Nishijima. He also becomes popular in school until Masato Kadowaki comes to his first day of class due to a broken leg and being hospitalized. He is then made fun of by Masato (who doesn’t like him due to the fact that he slowed down during track training to let Masato win as he might not have been able to compete in the next meet) and the rest of the school. Later his desk gets covered in glue and he finds out that he is betrayed by his best friend Suguru.

After being made fun of and after school is over he wishes to disappear so that everyone can be happy. He loses all trust in people by saying it is pointless to trust people as they only betray you. As he is walking around he hears a voice call for him in an alley, and as he enters the alley everything becomes black. Although he finds that he is no longer in Japan, but rather a new world that is known as Amawakuni (he finds that out a little later).

In Amawakuni he meets Kotoha who was worried about Arata. He is confused at what is going on and when Kannagi searches his “house” he comes across a rusted sword and activates its power and becomes a Sho. The sword is known as a Hayagami, or god, and its name is Goshintai. His Hayagami has the power of the wind.

Kotoha tells him that she will be there for him, and later finds out that he doesn’t have the stone (michihi no tama) that the princess game to him, so she gives him hers. He later gets arrested and as he is in a holding cell he talks to Arata by the power of the stone. He finds out that Kannagi was behind the murder of the princess and that Arata was framed for it. During his trail he is exiled to Gatoya Island (it’s known for being the same as hell). On the trip to the island Kotoha tags along and gives him his Hayagami. Also because of the stones power he is able to talk to the princess (who is just barely alive) and she asks him to govern the world as other wise there will only be war and blood shed.

On the island he meets Kanate and Ginchi who try to steal everything he has as well as kotoha. He trades the people everyday items from Japan (no one has seen anything like that before) for information, and later finds out that Gatoya Island is like a man eating island and that it is controlled by a Sho named Tsutsuga. After facing Tsutsuga in a fight he is given Warden’s power and returns the island back to normal. He later escapes with his new friends Kanate and Ginchi as well as Kotoha on a ship back to the main land to as he starts his journey on restoring order and saving the princess.

Shiro is an 11-year-old genius NEET, hikikomori gamer who is a part of 『　　』 (Blank or Kuuhaku) player, along with her step-brother, Sora.

Shiro is described as a genius in logic and problems, but has difficulty understanding emotions or behavior, relying on Sora to help her defeat human opponents such as Tet in their chess match. She also rarely shows much emotion at all on her face and, despite her genius intellect, speaks in short terse sentences. Shiro is extremely close to her brother, to the point of needing him by her side at all times to be comfortable. She is also shown to have a dry and somewhat twisted sense of humor, and displays signs of jealousy if Sora pays serious attention to other girls, showing she has a brother complex.

Abandoned by his parents, Sora is a brilliant NEET hikikomori gamer along with his stepsister, Shiro. He does not take life very seriously and is pretty much a good-for-nothing gamer. One day, he and his sister are called into an alternate world.

Sora is tall and thin with spiky brown hair, and constantly wears a sly grin on his face. Despite being a NEET and a shut in, Sora is extremely outgoing and confident, and is not afraid to play games with people face-to-face, even when they are cheating. He is also extremely manipulative, which he refers to as using negotiating skills. This fits in with his play style. While Shiro is excellent at logic and computing, Sora can read people and predict what their next move is, using this knowledge to beat them.

However, if he is separated from Shiro by so much as a closed door, he becomes a spineless, cowardly wreck, and only returns to his former self if he is able to see her. He views his sister as his equal and partner, but is also protective of her, shown by actions such as putting his body between her and the ground when he thought they were going to hit hard when first arriving on Disboard.

Sora is extroverted and has no problems dealing with people. While not as intelligent as Shiro, he is shown to have a brilliant IQ. Rather than computing numbers like Shiro, Sora can rapidly compute what his opponents are going to do based on observing their behavior and motivations. He is also slightly perverted and desires a girlfriend for himself. His lust leads to a linguistic mistake that causes Stephanie to fall in love with him and causes him to receive a scolding from Shiro.

Age: 6407

Jibril is the youngest and strongest of the Flügel race. Her love toward knowledge started even before the declaration of the Ten Oaths. She is against the book sharing law created by the Council of Eighteen Wings and left Avant Heim, her homeland, to win the National Library of Elchea from the previous king in a game. When Sora heard what happened to the library, he challenged Jibril in order to gain knowledge of the other kingdoms. When she lost the game, she became Sora and Shiro's servant since she had bet everything she owned, including herself, claiming that knowledge was worth her own life. However, she was allowed to keep the library and maintain it although she now must share it with the rest of Imanity. Jibril thus took the siblings as her masters and over time she began to understand and accept Sora's belief in the potential of humans.

According to Azriel, Jibril was given the gift of imperfection by Artosh. This gift is what Artosh believed would allow Jibril to find the answer to the Flügels' continued existence should he disappear (which was, in fact, the case).

Apollon is the Greek God of the Sun. He behaves and looks like a noble. He likes to be motivated by different things and is a charismatic leader. He is very cheerful, overenthusiastic. He tends to say things twice regardless of the situation. Although he looks like a perfect man but he still feels something is lacking. He looks cheerful and bright, but he is actually very lonely. He tries to make friends wherever he goes by doing things for them.

He is not very fond of plants, as in the mythology, his former lovers turned into plants. Nevertheless, he is knowledgeable about them. Apollon is very close to his uncle Hades and half-brother Dionysus, but has a strained relationship with his father Zeus. His name comes from the name of Apollo's bow and arrow. His limiter is a peridot ring on his right ring finger.

Hades is the Greek God of the Underworld. A quiet person and takes distances from other people. Apollon's uncle and Zeus' older brother. Likes sweet things. Thinks of himself as unlucky and cursed. He has an aura which makes everyone difficult to approach him. Despite being cold outside actually Hades is soft on the inside. He believes that coming close to him will bring misery to people, so he keeps everyone away from him.

His puns are rather cold and lame to the other gods. His name comes from the helmet of invisibility that Hades wears. He is very well versed in constellations, though most of the stories he tells behind them are tragedies. He likes daifuku simply because it means ""good luck."" In routes other than his own he takes care of a tortoise named Sadalsuud, which means ""luckiest of lucky stars."" His limiter is a skull necklace with a garnet gem.

Balder is the Norse God of Light. He is a cheerful god, who attracts a lot of people because he is the god of light. He often trips where there is nothing to be tripped on. He absolutely loves meat and will eat it for every meal if he could. Balder has a carnivorous personality and is very forward when it comes to making his advances on Yui. He cannot be harmed by any object because his mother Frigg made a pact with all objects on earth not to harm him. Even when there is rain, there comes a magical barrier that protects him from it.

Tsukito is the Japanese God of the Moon. Young boy who seems cool, not interested in anything and rarely shows expressions. Nevertheless he is responsible and dutiful. Although he is an unsociable person, he somehow always gets involved with Apollon and gets dragged into the problem. He sees the idea of the school as just another task or a mission and tries to perform it without getting emotionally involved. He enjoys moon gazing, being god of the Moon. He has a rabbit familiar called Usamaro, named by Takeru. It is also mentioned he has other unnamed rabbit familiars. His limiter is an amethyst bracelet on his right hand.

Takeru is the Japanese god of the Sea and Storms. Short tempered and brash, he often gets into fights without realising it. He calls Yui ""雑草, Zassou"" (weed). Worships his elder brother Tsukito, but has a difficult relationship with Akira. Surprisingly, he can get emotional rather easily. Doesn't really get along well with anyone except Tsukito and Hades (whom he admires due to being the god of the underworld). He prides himself in swordplay and is very skilled in it. To calm down, he likes to take walks by the beach, being a god of the sea. Takeru finds animals cute, and sometimes plays with Tsukito's familiar, Usamaro. His limiter is an anklet with an aquamarine gem. His name comes from the Totsuka-no-Tsurugi.

Egyptian God of wisdom and creation and responsible for awaking of the world. He is the type of guy who exerts a lot of pressure on his students. He loves corn to the point of having it everyday for 3 meals and spends most of his time in the library. Thoth has the ability to speed read and devour as much information from the books that he has read. He is responsible for the leadership and is a tutor in the school. Very proud and confident, he does not take consultations if he is not in the mood. Since he knows everything in the universe, he cannot be debated with. He seems very interested about the aspect of humanity and quizzes Yui about the meaning of these questions.
He is strict, intimidating, and somewhat short-tempered.

Thoth wears an open grey shirt with grey pants and snakeskin boots, with a blue school coat over it. He tends to wear blue, green and gold Egyptian accessories. He wears a monocle.
In his deity form he wears Ancient Egyptian garb, and bird wings grow out of his back, since he is traditionally an Ibis-headed god.

He doesn’t have the need for a limiter, but it is said to be the snake motif on his necklace. He is the only one that can understand Anubis Ma'at.

He's known to be very picky with his food, usually eating only corn, but he would eat things like red bean soup if it is available. In the drama cd, he is seen to be enjoying popcorn too.

Shiro is an 11-year-old genius NEET, hikikomori gamer who is a part of 『　　』 (Blank or Kuuhaku) player, along with her step-brother, Sora.

Shiro is described as a genius in logic and problems, but has difficulty understanding emotions or behavior, relying on Sora to help her defeat human opponents such as Tet in their chess match. She also rarely shows much emotion at all on her face and, despite her genius intellect, speaks in short terse sentences. Shiro is extremely close to her brother, to the point of needing him by her side at all times to be comfortable. She is also shown to have a dry and somewhat twisted sense of humor, and displays signs of jealousy if Sora pays serious attention to other girls, showing she has a brother complex.

Abandoned by his parents, Sora is a brilliant NEET hikikomori gamer along with his stepsister, Shiro. He does not take life very seriously and is pretty much a good-for-nothing gamer. One day, he and his sister are called into an alternate world.

Sora is tall and thin with spiky brown hair, and constantly wears a sly grin on his face. Despite being a NEET and a shut in, Sora is extremely outgoing and confident, and is not afraid to play games with people face-to-face, even when they are cheating. He is also extremely manipulative, which he refers to as using negotiating skills. This fits in with his play style. While Shiro is excellent at logic and computing, Sora can read people and predict what their next move is, using this knowledge to beat them.

However, if he is separated from Shiro by so much as a closed door, he becomes a spineless, cowardly wreck, and only returns to his former self if he is able to see her. He views his sister as his equal and partner, but is also protective of her, shown by actions such as putting his body between her and the ground when he thought they were going to hit hard when first arriving on Disboard.

Sora is extroverted and has no problems dealing with people. While not as intelligent as Shiro, he is shown to have a brilliant IQ. Rather than computing numbers like Shiro, Sora can rapidly compute what his opponents are going to do based on observing their behavior and motivations. He is also slightly perverted and desires a girlfriend for himself. His lust leads to a linguistic mistake that causes Stephanie to fall in love with him and causes him to receive a scolding from Shiro.

Age: 6407

Jibril is the youngest and strongest of the Flügel race. Her love toward knowledge started even before the declaration of the Ten Oaths. She is against the book sharing law created by the Council of Eighteen Wings and left Avant Heim, her homeland, to win the National Library of Elchea from the previous king in a game. When Sora heard what happened to the library, he challenged Jibril in order to gain knowledge of the other kingdoms. When she lost the game, she became Sora and Shiro's servant since she had bet everything she owned, including herself, claiming that knowledge was worth her own life. However, she was allowed to keep the library and maintain it although she now must share it with the rest of Imanity. Jibril thus took the siblings as her masters and over time she began to understand and accept Sora's belief in the potential of humans.

According to Azriel, Jibril was given the gift of imperfection by Artosh. This gift is what Artosh believed would allow Jibril to find the answer to the Flügels' continued existence should he disappear (which was, in fact, the case).

He is the guild master of Ainz Ooal Gown, Overlord of the Great Tomb of Nazarick, and the creator of Pandora's Actor. He is regarded as the highest of the Almighty Forty-One Supreme Beings by the NPCs of Nazarick.

A cautious and stingy person, Momonga always tries to plan and control details, avoiding any haphazard actions. Because he doesn't underestimate his opponents, he will usually overkill them. Since being transferred to a new world and becoming an actual Undead being, Momonga could feel himself becoming very cold and calculating, his emotions repressed.

Loyal to his friends and creations, since becoming Lord Ruler of Nazarick in the new world he acts with a certain degree of nobility for his devoted followers. Momonga only does things that will benefit Nazarick or himself, whether it's information or prestige. Although he does have a sense of justice and doesn't hate humans as much as his followers, he holds no attachment to them, and he feels nothing toward their deaths.

He meets with the mythril-ranked adventurer teams of E-Rantel: Kralgra, Sky Wolf, Rainbow, and Darkness, along with E-Rantel's mayor Panasolei Gruze Day Rettenmaier and Magic Caster Guildmaster Theo Lachesil to discuss the appearance of the powerful vampire Honyopenyoko.

She is in charge of the general management and supervises the activities of the seven Floor Guardians, meaning that she ranks above all the other NPCs in Nazarick. She is the sister of Nigredo and Spinel. She was created by Tabula Smaragdina.

An impeccable beauty, Albedo is a woman with lustrous jet-black hair and the face of a goddess. She has golden irises and vertically split pupils; on her left and right temples are two thick horns protruding crookedly, and on her waist is a pair of black angel wings.

Albedo wears a pure white dress with silky gloves covering her slender hands, and a golden spiderweb necklace that covers her shoulders and chest. In combat, she wears an impressive black full plate armor with a unique helm and carries a battle-axe with her.

Like Shalltear, Albedo has a true form as a heteromorphic race NPC. Shalltear called her a ""big mouthed gorilla"" when they quarreled, so her true form may be quite large in size.

Extremely loyal and extremely in love, Albedo is completely infatuated with Momonga, often showing obsessive tendencies when it comes to his affairs. She is always vying for Momonga's affection, showcasing outbursts of jealousy whenever anyone else appears to be getting close to him. This is because the last thing Momonga did in Yggdrasil was to use his administrative privileges to edit her character history, adding the she is ""madly in love"" with him.

Among all the Guardians, Albedo is the most vocal when it comes to expressing opinions. She will openly denounce any statement or action deemed inappropriate, reaching the point where Momonga sometimes considers it an annoyance.

As the Overseer of the Floor Guardians, she is very levelheaded. Albedo can make calm and collected judgments that Ainz, sometimes, doesn't think of. She takes Ainz's orders as top priority and absolute, punishing anyone, even a Floor Guardian, who'd dare belittle his orders. Like many others in Nazarick, she absolutely loathes humans and views them as an inferior species.

In the web novel version, Albedo does not exist.

She is a beauty with an intelligent look, wearing glasses and a choker. She wears her hair tied into a low-cropped bun at the back of her head. Lacking a metal plate in front of her skirt, her dress emphasizes mobility rather than defense. She is equipped with spiked gauntlets.

As shown in her karma value, Yuri is good-hearted and one of the two ""safe"" Pleiades to humans. Thus, she felt relief when Ainz said not to kill humans without proper reason. When given permission to do as she pleases, she chooses to help people in destitution. She uses ""boku"" as a first-person pronoun when speaking in private, revealing a somewhat childish nature.

Her behavior is strict like a teacher's. Due to her personality, she often works as a chairperson.

With his ability, Kazuma learns basic skills such as stealing, archery, monster detection, and basic magic.

She is in charge of the general management and supervises the activities of the seven Floor Guardians, meaning that she ranks above all the other NPCs in Nazarick. She is the sister of Nigredo and Spinel. She was created by Tabula Smaragdina.

An impeccable beauty, Albedo is a woman with lustrous jet-black hair and the face of a goddess. She has golden irises and vertically split pupils; on her left and right temples are two thick horns protruding crookedly, and on her waist is a pair of black angel wings.

Albedo wears a pure white dress with silky gloves covering her slender hands, and a golden spiderweb necklace that covers her shoulders and chest. In combat, she wears an impressive black full plate armor with a unique helm and carries a battle-axe with her.

Like Shalltear, Albedo has a true form as a heteromorphic race NPC. Shalltear called her a ""big mouthed gorilla"" when they quarreled, so her true form may be quite large in size.

Extremely loyal and extremely in love, Albedo is completely infatuated with Momonga, often showing obsessive tendencies when it comes to his affairs. She is always vying for Momonga's affection, showcasing outbursts of jealousy whenever anyone else appears to be getting close to him. This is because the last thing Momonga did in Yggdrasil was to use his administrative privileges to edit her character history, adding the she is ""madly in love"" with him.

Among all the Guardians, Albedo is the most vocal when it comes to expressing opinions. She will openly denounce any statement or action deemed inappropriate, reaching the point where Momonga sometimes considers it an annoyance.

As the Overseer of the Floor Guardians, she is very levelheaded. Albedo can make calm and collected judgments that Ainz, sometimes, doesn't think of. She takes Ainz's orders as top priority and absolute, punishing anyone, even a Floor Guardian, who'd dare belittle his orders. Like many others in Nazarick, she absolutely loathes humans and views them as an inferior species.

In the web novel version, Albedo does not exist.

He is regarded as the highest of the Almighty Forty-One Supreme Beings by the NPCs of Nazarick.

A cautious and stingy person, Momonga always tries to plan and control details, avoiding any haphazard actions. Because he doesn't underestimate his opponents, he will usually overkill them. Since being transferred to a new world and becoming an actual Undead being, Momonga could feel himself becoming very cold and calculating, his emotions repressed.

Loyal to his friends and creations, since becoming Lord Ruler of Nazarick in the new world he acts with a certain degree of nobility for his devoted followers. Momonga only does things that will benefit Nazarick or himself, whether it's information or prestige. Although he does have a sense of justice and doesn't hate humans as much as his followers, he holds no attachment to them, and he feels nothing toward their deaths.

When given permission to do as she pleases, she chooses to help people in destitution. She uses ""boku"" as a first-person pronoun when speaking in private, revealing a somewhat childish nature.

Like many others in Nazarick, Narberal views humans as low-class creatures. The only human exempt from her contempt is the lastborn of Pleiades. Though she does not particularly enjoy killing humans, she will not hesitate to do so if there's no reason to let them live. This nature makes her one of the two, along with Solution Epsilon, ""extremely dangerous"" Pleiades.

As a created NPC of Nazarick, she is extremely loyal to Momonga and proud of her quest to support him close by. Nevertheless, she does not understand Momonga's purpose to become a hero very well, so she does not hide her aggressive attitude towards humans and often refers to Momonga's alias Ainz with ""-sama,"" even when the two masquerade as adventurers.

In the web novel version, Narberal is also a doppelganger, though she used illusion magic to become the adventurer named Momon. Also in that version, she was created by Nishikienrai.

Entoma has the appearance of a girl wearing clothing similar to the traditional Japanese style. Her eyes are cute, but they never twinkle or blink. She has brown hair with twin chignon. She never exposes bare skin except her face.

Her true form is an arachnoid. Her face is a mask-shaped insect and her hair is formed from an organization similar to a rolled centipede's. She also disguises her voice with that of a cute girl by using a leech that steals human victim's voice. Her original voice is harsh and grating, similar to that of Cocytus. However, she does not like her original voice, so she becomes quiet when she loses her fake voice.

Entoma likes to eat humans, her favorite part being the muscular arm of men, though she doesn't mind what kind of person she eats if she is given an opportunity. If there are no humans to eat, she eats snacks called ""green biscuits"" instead. Despite treating humans as food, Entoma's nature is not considered extremely evil. If she comes across humans when she is sated and they do not bother her, she will ignore them rather than eat them.

The main female protagonist. She is a silver-haired half-elf girl who is one of the candidates to become the next ruler in the royal election. Subaru first meets her when her insignia is stolen by Felt as she needs to possess it to be eligible to participate in the election. She introduces herself as Satella when she and Subaru met during the first timeline before introducing herself by her real name when she got her insignia back.

Emilia is good natured and likes to take care of others, though she herself refuses to admit it, instead thinking of it as her own selfishness. She is indifferent to her own appearance, leaving Puck to take care of her clothes and hair. Because her appearance is similar to the Witch of Envy, she has received unfair discrimination from others.

On the way home from the convenience store, he suddenly finds himself transported into another world. He has the ability that he calls ""Return by Death"" to go back in time when he dies, with only himself being aware of the reversal of time. Despite being a hikikomori and gamer in his real world, Subaru does a bit of workout and seems to know basic hand-to-hand combat, making him not completely weak.

While Subaru tends to not read the situation, he is loyal to those he holds dear, willing to help them, even if that means taking the thorny path. He has his resolve confirmed through the many situations and circumstances he faces in the fantasy world, originally having been one to always take the ""easy"" route. As a hikikomori, he is hopeful of the possibilities that being sucked into a new realm brings, but later realizes the realities of the predicament he is in. Ultimately, he resolves himself to be faithful and protective of the ones that he cares most about.

Al has a frivolous and goofy personality, and having spent more than ten years in a different world, he was easily able to get along with Subaru. Despite being Priscilla's knight, he doesn't really recognize himself as one, seeing himself as her caretaker, while Priscilla herself sees him as a handyman and a fool to entertain her. He has no qualms about their relationship. He also brags that the only way he can fight is by outwitting people and catching them by surprise.

It is later revealed that Ranta is fully aware of his actions and purposely made himself hated, so that the rest of the party would have something common to unite against.

Ranta is somewhat scrawny, but appears to possess a wiry strength as a Dark Knight. He has unruly deep red-auburn hair, red/brown eyes, and a near permanent smirk or sneer on his face.

Ranta serves as an second tank to the party. Being lightly armoured, the Dread Knight make use of the terrain and the reach of his own weapon to position himself out of the enemies striking range while using sword-skills to strike back.

Shihoru is a short girl with short light purple hair and purple eyes. She constantly says that she is overweight even though the rest of party says that she is not.

As a Mage with virtually no defensive skills, Shihoru relies on the rest of the party to distract the enemies while charging up spells to stun or disable the target from range. Currently it is unknown if the numbers of spells are limited by Spiritual strength or bound by the number of spell memorization.

Yume has pale skin, reddish brown braided hair and brown eyes. In battle, she wears a Hunter outfit that the guild provided to her.

The goddess of water who judged humans to send to the RPG world, up until Kazuma dragged her along with him. She is an energetic and simpleminded girl who likes to receive reverence for her status and gets upset easily. As an Archpriest and a goddess, she is powerful against demons and the undead, and is able to resurrect recently deceased people as well as purify water supplies. Rather than learning skills which would benefit her party, she spends most of her skill points learning Party Tricks.

He is the guild master of Ainz Ooal Gown, Overlord of the Great Tomb of Nazarick, and the creator of Pandora's Actor. He is regarded as the highest of the Almighty Forty-One Supreme Beings by the NPCs of Nazarick.

A cautious and stingy person, Momonga always tries to plan and control details, avoiding any haphazard actions. Because he doesn't underestimate his opponents, he will usually overkill them. Since being transferred to a new world and becoming an actual Undead being, Momonga could feel himself becoming very cold and calculating, his emotions repressed.

Loyal to his friends and creations, since becoming Lord Ruler of Nazarick in the new world he acts with a certain degree of nobility for his devoted followers. Momonga only does things that will benefit Nazarick or himself, whether it's information or prestige. Although he does have a sense of justice and doesn't hate humans as much as his followers, he holds no attachment to them, and he feels nothing toward their deaths.

She is in charge of the general management and supervises the activities of the seven Floor Guardians, meaning that she ranks above all the other NPCs in Nazarick. She is the sister of Nigredo and Spinel. She was created by Tabula Smaragdina.

An impeccable beauty, Albedo is a woman with lustrous jet-black hair and the face of a goddess. She has golden irises and vertically split pupils; on her left and right temples are two thick horns protruding crookedly, and on her waist is a pair of black angel wings.

Albedo wears a pure white dress with silky gloves covering her slender hands, and a golden spiderweb necklace that covers her shoulders and chest. In combat, she wears an impressive black full plate armor with a unique helm and carries a battle-axe with her.

Like Shalltear, Albedo has a true form as a heteromorphic race NPC. Shalltear called her a ""big mouthed gorilla"" when they quarreled, so her true form may be quite large in size.

Extremely loyal and extremely in love, Albedo is completely infatuated with Momonga, often showing obsessive tendencies when it comes to his affairs. She is always vying for Momonga's affection, showcasing outbursts of jealousy whenever anyone else appears to be getting close to him. This is because the last thing Momonga did in Yggdrasil was to use his administrative privileges to edit her character history, adding the she is ""madly in love"" with him.

Among all the Guardians, Albedo is the most vocal when it comes to expressing opinions. She will openly denounce any statement or action deemed inappropriate, reaching the point where Momonga sometimes considers it an annoyance.

As the Overseer of the Floor Guardians, she is very levelheaded. Albedo can make calm and collected judgments that Ainz, sometimes, doesn't think of. She takes Ainz's orders as top priority and absolute, punishing anyone, even a Floor Guardian, who'd dare belittle his orders. Like many others in Nazarick, she absolutely loathes humans and views them as an inferior species.

In the web novel version, Albedo does not exist.

As shown in her karma value, Yuri is good-hearted and one of the two ""safe"" Pleiades to humans. Thus, she felt relief when Ainz said not to kill humans without proper reason. When given permission to do as she pleases, she chooses to help people in destitution. She uses ""boku"" as a first-person pronoun when speaking in private, revealing a somewhat childish nature.

Her behavior is strict like a teacher's. Due to her personality, she often works as a chairperson.

Lupusregina has a very bright and outgoing personality but is also able to conduct herself like a perfect lady. She is sociable and friendly toward humans, though it is only a mask to conceal her brutal and cunning personality. She also likes to make lewd jokes.

She had a tendency to suddenly appear behind people and disappear without notice.

Occupation: 1st~3rd Floor Guardian
Karma: Negative 450 (Very~Extremely Evil)
Creator: Peroroncino

Shalltear is a true vampire and the Floor Guardian of the first to third floors in the Great Tomb of Nazarick. She was created by Peroroncino.

Shalltear has a very flirtatious personality and is very open with her sexual preferences, often to other characters' discomfort. Despite her apparent shamelessness, she can be quite innocent about certain things. She has a complex about her small figure, which she attempts to cover up by using breast pads.

As a true vampire, Shalltear is extremely proud and takes her position as a Floor Guardian very seriously. She has no patience for failure and will often burst into fits of rage at signs of an unfavorable situation. She will not hesitate to kill any servant who disappoints her; however, she will not punish others for failing in tasks that are impossible to begin with.

Shalltear is completely loyal to Momonga and is also a love rival to Albedo for his affections. She takes great joy in being able to prove her worth and fantasizes about the praise she expects to receive. When a situation doesn't go in her favor, she panics about the scolding she believes that she will get.

She is a woman around twenty years old, with short blonde hair and delicate features, giving her a cat-like appearance. Her armor is made from the medals she has taken as a trophy off of the adventurers she has slain. Her favorite weapons are the stilettos she wears on her side, though she also uses a mace and a mythril estoc coated with orichalcum.

Clementine is a true psychopath obsessed with inflicting pain and murder. Having a background in the Black Scripture, Clementine is extremely confident in her abilities, going so far as to declare herself unbeatable. Before she went rogue, Clementine held the 9th seat in the Black Scripture. Betraying the Scripture, she stole the magical Crown of Wisdom from one of the six Shaman-Princesses of the Theocracy, forcing her to flee and join Zuranon.

With a tail twice as long as his height, Cocytus is covered with sharp spikes like icicles and has a strong jaw that can easily snap people's hands. Two of his hands hold a silver halberd, while the remaining two hands hold a mace emitting black light and a crooked shape sheath which seems to be for a broadsword. With a breathtaking cold air, the pale blue, hardened bone armor oozes out diamond dust like bright light. His shoulders and back look like an uplifted iceberg.

She wears accessories with military camouflage patterns. While her face is beautiful, she does not show her emotions and talks in a flat tone.

CZ2128 appears emotionless and has a silent nature. Her Karma is relatively high, which makes her, along with Yuri Alpha, one of the two ""safe"" Pleiades to humans. Though she usually ignores conversations from humans, sometimes there is a possibility to communicate with her. She hates cannibalism and likes cute things, such as Eclair.

CZ2128's creator was one of the Supreme Beings, other than Tabula Smaragdina, responsible for the design of Treasury security systems. Thus her character settings are set to be familiar with Nazarick's mechanism unlocking methods.

In the web novel version, she was created by Tabula Smaragdina.

He bears many similarities with Sora, being his black hair, slender body, black eyes and his face. Riku is a master strategist and manipulator, much like Sora.

Age: 6407

Jibril is the youngest and strongest of the Flügel race. Her love toward knowledge started even before the declaration of the Ten Oaths. She is against the book sharing law created by the Council of Eighteen Wings and left Avant Heim, her homeland, to win the National Library of Elchea from the previous king in a game. When Sora heard what happened to the library, he challenged Jibril in order to gain knowledge of the other kingdoms. When she lost the game, she became Sora and Shiro's servant since she had bet everything she owned, including herself, claiming that knowledge was worth her own life. However, she was allowed to keep the library and maintain it although she now must share it with the rest of Imanity. Jibril thus took the siblings as her masters and over time she began to understand and accept Sora's belief in the potential of humans.

According to Azriel, Jibril was given the gift of imperfection by Artosh. This gift is what Artosh believed would allow Jibril to find the answer to the Flügels' continued existence should he disappear (which was, in fact, the case).

An impeccable beauty, Albedo is a woman with lustrous jet-black hair and the face of a goddess. She has golden irises and vertically split pupils; on her left and right temples are two thick horns protruding crookedly, and on her waist is a pair of black angel wings.

Albedo wears a pure white dress with silky gloves covering her slender hands, and a golden spiderweb necklace that covers her shoulders and chest. In combat, she wears an impressive black full plate armor with a unique helm and carries a battle-axe with her.

Like Shalltear, Albedo has a true form as a heteromorphic race NPC. Shalltear called her a ""big mouthed gorilla"" when they quarreled, so her true form may be quite large in size.

Extremely loyal and extremely in love, Albedo is completely infatuated with Momonga, often showing obsessive tendencies when it comes to his affairs. She is always vying for Momonga's affection, showcasing outbursts of jealousy whenever anyone else appears to be getting close to him. This is because the last thing Momonga did in Yggdrasil was to use his administrative privileges to edit her character history, adding the she is ""madly in love"" with him.

Among all the Guardians, Albedo is the most vocal when it comes to expressing opinions. She will openly denounce any statement or action deemed inappropriate, reaching the point where Momonga sometimes considers it an annoyance.

As the Overseer of the Floor Guardians, she is very levelheaded. Albedo can make calm and collected judgments that Ainz, sometimes, doesn't think of. She takes Ainz's orders as top priority and absolute, punishing anyone, even a Floor Guardian, who'd dare belittle his orders. Like many others in Nazarick, she absolutely loathes humans and views them as an inferior species.

In the web novel version, Albedo does not exist.

Race: Heteromorphic Race, Undead, True Vampire
Occupation: 1st~3rd Floor Guardian
Karma: Negative 450 (Very~Extremely Evil)
Creator: Peroroncino

Shalltear is a true vampire and the Floor Guardian of the first to third floors in the Great Tomb of Nazarick. She was created by Peroroncino.

Shalltear has a very flirtatious personality and is very open with her sexual preferences, often to other characters' discomfort. Despite her apparent shamelessness, she can be quite innocent about certain things. She has a complex about her small figure, which she attempts to cover up by using breast pads.

As a true vampire, Shalltear is extremely proud and takes her position as a Floor Guardian very seriously. She has no patience for failure and will often burst into fits of rage at signs of an unfavorable situation. She will not hesitate to kill any servant who disappoints her; however, she will not punish others for failing in tasks that are impossible to begin with.

Shalltear is completely loyal to Momonga and is also a love rival to Albedo for his affections. She takes great joy in being able to prove her worth and fantasizes about the praise she expects to receive. When a situation doesn't go in her favor, she panics about the scolding she believes that she will get.

Although her features aren’t bad and her eyes are sharp, she doesn't wear makeup and her skin is wheat colored after long exposure to the sun. Her arms have solid muscles and her hands are full of calluses from wielding a sword.

Her favorite weapons are the stilettos she wears on her side, though she also uses a mace and a mythril estoc coated with orichalcum.

Clementine is a true psychopath obsessed with inflicting pain and murder. Having a background in the Black Scripture, Clementine is extremely confident in her abilities, going so far as to declare herself unbeatable. Before she went rogue, Clementine held the 9th seat in the Black Scripture. Betraying the Scripture, she stole the magical Crown of Wisdom from one of the six Shaman-Princesses of the Theocracy, forcing her to flee and join Zuranon.

Race: Heteromorphic Race, Undead, True Vampire
Occupation: 1st~3rd Floor Guardian
Karma: Negative 450 (Very~Extremely Evil)
Creator: Peroroncino

Shalltear is a true vampire and the Floor Guardian of the first to third floors in the Great Tomb of Nazarick. She was created by Peroroncino.

Shalltear has a very flirtatious personality and is very open with her sexual preferences, often to other characters' discomfort. Despite her apparent shamelessness, she can be quite innocent about certain things. She has a complex about her small figure, which she attempts to cover up by using breast pads.

As a true vampire, Shalltear is extremely proud and takes her position as a Floor Guardian very seriously. She has no patience for failure and will often burst into fits of rage at signs of an unfavorable situation. She will not hesitate to kill any servant who disappoints her; however, she will not punish others for failing in tasks that are impossible to begin with.

Shalltear is completely loyal to Momonga and is also a love rival to Albedo for his affections. She takes great joy in being able to prove her worth and fantasizes about the praise she expects to receive. When a situation doesn't go in her favor, she panics about the scolding she believes that she will get.

Around 20 years old or younger, she has untidy red hair trimmed short for easy movement. Although her features aren’t bad and her eyes are sharp, she doesn't wear makeup and her skin is wheat colored after long exposure to the sun. Her arms have solid muscles and her hands are full of calluses from wielding a sword.


In the web novel version, she obtained the potion differently by sharing the same room with Momonga who did not like the smell from herb she used to cure wounds, so he gave her a potion.

In real life, she was a famous voice actress, who often played young girl characters in eroge to earn money.

He is regarded as the highest of the Almighty Forty-One Supreme Beings by the NPCs of Nazarick.

A cautious and stingy person, Momonga always tries to plan and control details, avoiding any haphazard actions. Because he doesn't underestimate his opponents, he will usually overkill them. Since being transferred to a new world and becoming an actual Undead being, Momonga could feel himself becoming very cold and calculating, his emotions repressed.

Loyal to his friends and creations, since becoming Lord Ruler of Nazarick in the new world he acts with a certain degree of nobility for his devoted followers. Momonga only does things that will benefit Nazarick or himself, whether it's information or prestige. Although he does have a sense of justice and doesn't hate humans as much as his followers, he holds no attachment to them, and he feels nothing toward their deaths.

She ran away from home to have an adventure, while she was still inexperienced, she was saved by Gagaran and the two became partners.

She is in charge of the general management and supervises the activities of the seven Floor Guardians, meaning that she ranks above all the other NPCs in Nazarick. She is the sister of Nigredo and Spinel. She was created by Tabula Smaragdina.

An impeccable beauty, Albedo is a woman with lustrous jet-black hair and the face of a goddess. She has golden irises and vertically split pupils; on her left and right temples are two thick horns protruding crookedly, and on her waist is a pair of black angel wings.

Albedo wears a pure white dress with silky gloves covering her slender hands, and a golden spiderweb necklace that covers her shoulders and chest. In combat, she wears an impressive black full plate armor with a unique helm and carries a battle-axe with her.

Like Shalltear, Albedo has a true form as a heteromorphic race NPC. Shalltear called her a ""big mouthed gorilla"" when they quarreled, so her true form may be quite large in size.

Extremely loyal and extremely in love, Albedo is completely infatuated with Momonga, often showing obsessive tendencies when it comes to his affairs. She is always vying for Momonga's affection, showcasing outbursts of jealousy whenever anyone else appears to be getting close to him. This is because the last thing Momonga did in Yggdrasil was to use his administrative privileges to edit her character history, adding the she is ""madly in love"" with him.

Among all the Guardians, Albedo is the most vocal when it comes to expressing opinions. She will openly denounce any statement or action deemed inappropriate, reaching the point where Momonga sometimes considers it an annoyance.

As the Overseer of the Floor Guardians, she is very levelheaded. Albedo can make calm and collected judgments that Ainz, sometimes, doesn't think of. She takes Ainz's orders as top priority and absolute, punishing anyone, even a Floor Guardian, who'd dare belittle his orders. Like many others in Nazarick, she absolutely loathes humans and views them as an inferior species.

In the web novel version, Albedo does not exist.

She is a beauty with an intelligent look, wearing glasses and a choker. She wears her hair tied into a low-cropped bun at the back of her head. Lacking a metal plate in front of her skirt, her dress emphasizes mobility rather than defense. She is equipped with spiked gauntlets.

As shown in her karma value, Yuri is good-hearted and one of the two ""safe"" Pleiades to humans. Thus, she felt relief when Ainz said not to kill humans without proper reason. When given permission to do as she pleases, she chooses to help people in destitution. She uses ""boku"" as a first-person pronoun when speaking in private, revealing a somewhat childish nature.

Her behavior is strict like a teacher's. Due to her personality, she often works as a chairperson.

One side of her hair is silver, while the other half is black. Antilene hides her ears with her hair. Though she looks like a teenage girl, her appearance has not been changed for a long time.

It seems that Antilene is bored with everything, as there is no one who can barely stand a chance against her. In spite of that, she was implied to have been a bit hopeful of facing eventual defeat one day by someone stronger than her through combat. In particular, Antilene wanted it to be that kind of individual who she can potentially mate with if such chances are actually possible regardless of their looks or personality.

At the same time, she hardly even bears no emotion of sadness for the death of someone from the same side. According to the Captain of the Black Scripture, Antilene's attitude was similar to asking about something unrelated to her. For him, this type of attitude fit right in with the style of Antilene. As well as usually ignoring an important announcement from the Cardinal Conference like the circumstances of her own group.

Due to the circumstances of her birth, she seems to be ashamed of her elven heritage and would constantly hide her ears. Antilene didn't like it when others such as the Captain of the Black Scripture looked at her ears. Nevertheless, she is hardly filled with neither curiosity or joy on any specific subject until mentioning a potential candidate of doing battle with. It was the urge to fight is what spurred her to have such blood-lust emotions excitingly.

Race: Heteromorphic Race, Undead, True Vampire
Occupation: 1st~3rd Floor Guardian
Karma: Negative 450 (Very~Extremely Evil)
Creator: Peroroncino

Shalltear is a true vampire and the Floor Guardian of the first to third floors in the Great Tomb of Nazarick. She was created by Peroroncino.

Shalltear has a very flirtatious personality and is very open with her sexual preferences, often to other characters' discomfort. Despite her apparent shamelessness, she can be quite innocent about certain things. She has a complex about her small figure, which she attempts to cover up by using breast pads.

As a true vampire, Shalltear is extremely proud and takes her position as a Floor Guardian very seriously. She has no patience for failure and will often burst into fits of rage at signs of an unfavorable situation. She will not hesitate to kill any servant who disappoints her; however, she will not punish others for failing in tasks that are impossible to begin with.

Shalltear is completely loyal to Momonga and is also a love rival to Albedo for his affections. She takes great joy in being able to prove her worth and fantasizes about the praise she expects to receive. When a situation doesn't go in her favor, she panics about the scolding she believes that she will get.

She is also a member of the First Nine. Her exact race and appearance is unknown. As Peroroncino described her as an ""odd-looking pink flesh,"" it seems her appearance is quite grotesque. She had trouble with making a party before she met Momonga and Touch Me due to her race.

In real life, she was a famous voice actress, who often played young girl characters in eroge to earn money.

Filo was originally hatched from a monster egg which Naofumi purchased from the slave trader.

Filo grew at an abnormally fast rate and in just a few days grown into a fully grown Filolial later developing into a rare species of Filolial Queen where she was later given the ability to transform into a humanoid form strongly resembling a Angel and the ability to talk due to her association with the Shield Hero and the effects of the Legendary Shield.

Naofumi Iwatani is the main protagonist of The Rising of the Shield Hero.

He was a university student before being summoned to another world, where he had to fight against the waves of calamity, as one of the 4 cardinal heroes summoned. He was, however, the shield hero, regarded by many and especially people in Melromarc as the weakest of the heroes.

Due to his status as shield hero, many refused to join his side, the only exception being Myne Sophia. Myne however falsely accuses him of sexual assault causing him to lose his dignity and all his money
Due to this, the once cheerful Naofumi became a cynical character who lost the ability to trust in people.

He buys the slave Raphtalia and the bird Filo, but treats them like his daughters rather than his slaves.

Raphtalia is a Tanuki-type Demi-Human who was the first real member of the Shield Hero's party after he purchased her as a slave.

She has undergone some significant changes throughout the story. When Raphtalia is first introduced, she is a child that has long, unmanaged hair and a dirty cloth gown. After being purchased by Naofumi, he gave her a haircut to an acceptable length, gave her a bath, and bought her a much more suitable set of clothes to adventure in.

After several weeks of traveling with Naofumi, Raphtalia's body inexplicably changes and she gained the appearance of a teenager or young adult. It is revealed that demi-humans grow in relation to the progression of their levels, which led to Raphtalia's rapid development.

Ren Amaki is the Sword Hero, one of the four holy heroes summoned in Melromarc.

Ren comes from an Alternative Japan. In the world he lives in everything is much more advanced and futuristic. In his world, every game in the modern era is run on VRMMO.

One day while on the way home from school, Ren was caught up in a murder case. The murder case was pretty well known around the town he lived in. Ren mentioned how he remembers saving his best friend and how the criminal arrested. Ren didn't go into too much detail after that but started rubbing his side when talking, it was suspected that Ren was probably stabbed on the side of his body during the struggle then later died from blood loss.

Before he knew it he woke up he found himself summoned to another world. The world reminded him a lot of the VRMMO he played in the previous world, Brave Star Online.

Ren is a person who acts cool and tries very hard to portray a loner's image. He runs his party like a guild, only working with the other members when the prey he seeks to kill is too strong for him to hunt alone. His attitude towards his comrades is that weaker members should work to individually increase their powers to catch up to the stronger ones.

He is a good judge of character just by looking at someone. He has a childish side which was made evident when he became giddy over the ship ride to Cal Mira Archipelago. He has a habit of calling the younger persons ""Kiddo."" He has high morals and doesn't want to hurt anyone who is irrelevant to his mission. He is charismatic enough to attract good people to his side.

The main female protagonist. She is a silver-haired half-elf girl who is one of the candidates to become the next ruler in the royal election. Subaru first meets her when her insignia is stolen by Felt as she needs to possess it to be eligible to participate in the election. She introduces herself as Satella when she and Subaru met during the first timeline before introducing herself by her real name when she got her insignia back.

Emilia is good natured and likes to take care of others, though she herself refuses to admit it, instead thinking of it as her own selfishness. She is indifferent to her own appearance, leaving Puck to take care of her clothes and hair. Because her appearance is similar to the Witch of Envy, she has received unfair discrimination from others. She sometimes acts like a child and is unacquainted with the world as she used to live in the woods with other Elves, though despite this she still works hard to become a ruler.",Main,"Takahashi, Rie, Mills, Kayli, Mendes, Lina, Leal, Lupita","Japanese, English, Portuguese (BR), Spanish","https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/78665.jpg?s=f6d673ce224e9558e9eebac399f102f4, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/78266.jpg?s=dd2dbcf2917cfb9b4bc45c157ded49f4, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/63474.jpg?s=ee1772a71a8733e11b3e706f7fc40428, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/25963.jpg?s=1fa9c097ae8f09f03bf8f4e124468e0b"

On the way home from the convenience store, he suddenly finds himself transported into another world. He has the ability that he calls ""Return by Death"" to go back in time when he dies, with only himself being aware of the reversal of time. Despite being a hikikomori and gamer in his real world, Subaru does a bit of workout and seems to know basic hand-to-hand combat, making him not completely weak.

While Subaru tends to not read the situation, he is loyal to those he holds dear, willing to help them, even if that means taking the thorny path. He has his resolve confirmed through the many situations and circumstances he faces in the fantasy world, originally having been one to always take the ""easy"" route. As a hikikomori, he is hopeful of the possibilities that being sucked into a new realm brings, but later realizes the realities of the predicament he is in. Ultimately, he resolves himself to be faithful and protective of the ones that he cares most about.

Sicily was described as a beautiful and cute young lady with waist-length blue hair, blue eyes and a body that attracts much male attention. Sicily is a very timid, soft-spoken, thoughtful, polite and shy girl who sometimes goes on a sudden outburst when driven into embarrassing situations.

She always tries to get along with others and normally puts others before herself, trying to make sure everyone is all right, physically or otherwise.

Full Name: Mahito Maki (牧 眞人)
Age (DoB): 12 or 13 (Unknown)
Nationality: Japanese
Work: The Boy and the Heron
Voice Actor: Soma Saito (Japanese), Luca Padovan (English)


Mahito Maki exhibits - unusually for his age - a contemplative and introverted demeanor. Whether it's natural or a product of the past, his modest demeanor does not indicate shyness. Rather, it conceals a bold and determined soul. Mahito is frequently portrayed in the movie as having a somber demeanor, suggesting his complexity and inner depth. Mahito's complex characterization makes him a compelling and sympathetic protagonist who draws the audience in with his quiet yet powerful presence. Mahito has a deep character since he can express a wide range of feelings with few words. His mannerisms, body language, and facial expressions all convey a picture of a young child who is both perceptive and introverted. His age plays a crucial role in shaping his experiences and responses in the film. It’s at this delicate stage of life that Mahito encounters profound loss, embarks on a journey of self-discovery, and learns to navigate complex emotions.

Mahito's mother perished tragically in a fire during the third year of the Pacific War, marking a turning point in his life. He and his father flee to the estate of his maternal grandparents as a result of this calamity. Mahito's connection with his stepmother Natsuko is still strained as he struggles with his mother's passing. She is only seen by him as ""his father's loved one,"" not as a mother. Mahito's journey is framed by this emotional upheaval, which emphasizes the effects of loss and transition on a developing mind. Another level of difficulty is added to Mahito's life with the advent of Natsuko as his stepmother. Their relationship, which is characterized by distance and veiled feelings, illustrates the difficulties of establishing new family ties in difficult situations. 

When Mahito meets a strange heron, his life takes an unexpected turn. This accidental encounter results in remarkable encounters that go beyond the commonplace. Mahito's journey is heavily influenced by the mysterious heron, who leads him into unknown areas. Mahito's conversation with the heron serves as an example of the theme of facing uncertainty and looking for direction in unlikely places. Mahito's growth during the movie depends on this relationship. In Mahito's life, the heron stands for the enigmatic and uncharted. Mahito is inspired to step beyond his comfort zone by this experience, which piques his curiosity and sense of wonder. The narrative advances through a dynamic interplay between Mahito's contemplative demeanor and the heron's mystery nature. Mahito and the heron develop a bond that goes beyond simple curiosity to something more profound and significant. As the narrative goes on, Mahito begins to rely on the heron as a source of knowledge and direction as he attempts to make sense of the confusing world he lives in. Their conversations enriched Mahito's character evolution and the story as a whole by shedding light on issues of friendship, trust, and the value of embracing the unknown.


Mahito's descent into the underworld is a life-changing event that signifies his development from a young child into an adult. This voyage is a representation of his inner struggle with difficult emotions and hard life realities. The difficulties and mysteries of the underworld serve as a metaphor for Mahito's development as a person. He gains the ability to maneuver through uncertainty, signifying his developing awareness of life's various dimensions. Mahito encounters a variety of entities and overcomes many obstacles in the underworld. These encounters put his fortitude to the test and compel him to change and develop. He gains insightful knowledge about bravery, tenacity, and the strength of the human spirit. His trip is a moving story of overcoming hardship and discovering inner fortitude since these difficulties in the underworld reflect his inner struggles. The culmination of Mahito’s journey in the underworld is a significant moment of self-realization and acceptance. He emerges not just physically from this realm, but also emotionally and mentally stronger. This part of the story highlights the theme of personal transformation through adversity, showing how challenges can lead to growth and self-discovery.

He was always bullied and was disliked by both of his male and female classmates for being close to their idol-like classmate Kaori. After wishing for his annoying classmates to be summoned to another world, the next thing he saw was they were on top of a pillar like structure in another world to become heroes.

He obtained the job of ""Synergist"" and continued to be bullied due to also being weak in this new world. He eventually fell into an abyss due to being hit by a classmate's fireball where he survived though a hell-like environment to become the powerful man he is today.

Hajime at the beginning of the story is said to have black hair and also has a slim body. He also had a kind face and attitude. But after falling in the abyss and eating a wolf-like monster, his body began to violently degenerate. When he drunk the sacred water, it made his body heal by destroying his bones and muscles then healing over and over again until he got a very muscular body due to overcompensation.

Due to the stress of breaking and healing, his hair turned white, a victim of the Marie Antoinette syndrome. His eyes also turned red and his body gained tattoo-like red lines which is the sign of him becoming a demonic monster similar to the monsters he ate that also possessed red lines along their bodies.

His personality was at first kind though he was considered incompetent. But after falling in the abyss, he became cruel and would kill any person who wants to cause him misfortune. He would also smile in front of danger which made Shia call him a new species of monster called ""Predator."" He may be cruel but he cares for his comrades.

He is the guild master of Ainz Ooal Gown, Overlord of the Great Tomb of Nazarick, and the creator of Pandora's Actor. He is regarded as the highest of the Almighty Forty-One Supreme Beings by the NPCs of Nazarick.

A cautious and stingy person, Momonga always tries to plan and control details, avoiding any haphazard actions. Because he doesn't underestimate his opponents, he will usually overkill them. Since being transferred to a new world and becoming an actual Undead being, Momonga could feel himself becoming very cold and calculating, his emotions repressed.

Loyal to his friends and creations, since becoming Lord Ruler of Nazarick in the new world he acts with a certain degree of nobility for his devoted followers. Momonga only does things that will benefit Nazarick or himself, whether it's information or prestige. Although he does have a sense of justice and doesn't hate humans as much as his followers, he holds no attachment to them, and he feels nothing toward their deaths.

She is in charge of the general management and supervises the activities of the seven Floor Guardians, meaning that she ranks above all the other NPCs in Nazarick. She is the sister of Nigredo and Spinel. She was created by Tabula Smaragdina.

An impeccable beauty, Albedo is a woman with lustrous jet-black hair and the face of a goddess. She has golden irises and vertically split pupils; on her left and right temples are two thick horns protruding crookedly, and on her waist is a pair of black angel wings.

Albedo wears a pure white dress with silky gloves covering her slender hands, and a golden spiderweb necklace that covers her shoulders and chest. In combat, she wears an impressive black full plate armor with a unique helm and carries a battle-axe with her.

Like Shalltear, Albedo has a true form as a heteromorphic race NPC. Shalltear called her a ""big mouthed gorilla"" when they quarreled, so her true form may be quite large in size.

Extremely loyal and extremely in love, Albedo is completely infatuated with Momonga, often showing obsessive tendencies when it comes to his affairs. She is always vying for Momonga's affection, showcasing outbursts of jealousy whenever anyone else appears to be getting close to him. This is because the last thing Momonga did in Yggdrasil was to use his administrative privileges to edit her character history, adding the she is ""madly in love"" with him.

Among all the Guardians, Albedo is the most vocal when it comes to expressing opinions. She will openly denounce any statement or action deemed inappropriate, reaching the point where Momonga sometimes considers it an annoyance.

As the Overseer of the Floor Guardians, she is very levelheaded. Albedo can make calm and collected judgments that Ainz, sometimes, doesn't think of. She takes Ainz's orders as top priority and absolute, punishing anyone, even a Floor Guardian, who'd dare belittle his orders. Like many others in Nazarick, she absolutely loathes humans and views them as an inferior species.

In the web novel version, Albedo does not exist.

As shown in her karma value, Yuri is good-hearted and one of the two ""safe"" Pleiades to humans. Thus, she felt relief when Ainz said not to kill humans without proper reason. When given permission to do as she pleases, she chooses to help people in destitution. She uses ""boku"" as a first-person pronoun when speaking in private, revealing a somewhat childish nature.

Her behavior is strict like a teacher's. Due to her personality, she often works as a chairperson.

Creator: Peroroncino

Shalltear is a true vampire and the Floor Guardian of the first to third floors in the Great Tomb of Nazarick. She was created by Peroroncino.

Shalltear has a very flirtatious personality and is very open with her sexual preferences, often to other characters' discomfort. Despite her apparent shamelessness, she can be quite innocent about certain things. She has a complex about her small figure, which she attempts to cover up by using breast pads.

As a true vampire, Shalltear is extremely proud and takes her position as a Floor Guardian very seriously. She has no patience for failure and will often burst into fits of rage at signs of an unfavorable situation. She will not hesitate to kill any servant who disappoints her; however, she will not punish others for failing in tasks that are impossible to begin with.

Shalltear is completely loyal to Momonga and is also a love rival to Albedo for his affections. She takes great joy in being able to prove her worth and fantasizes about the praise she expects to receive. When a situation doesn't go in her favor, she panics about the scolding she believes that she will get.

With a tail twice as long as his height, Cocytus is covered with sharp spikes like icicles and has a strong jaw that can easily snap people's hands. Two of his hands hold a silver halberd, while the remaining two hands hold a mace emitting black light and a crooked shape sheath which seems to be for a broadsword. With a breathtaking cold air, the pale blue, hardened bone armor oozes out diamond dust like bright light. His shoulders and back look like an uplifted iceberg.

She wears accessories with military camouflage patterns. While her face is beautiful, she does not show her emotions and talks in a flat tone.

CZ2128 appears emotionless and has a silent nature. Her Karma is relatively high, which makes her, along with Yuri Alpha, one of the two ""safe"" Pleiades to humans. Though she usually ignores conversations from humans, sometimes there is a possibility to communicate with her. She hates cannibalism and likes cute things, such as Eclair.

CZ2128's creator was one of the Supreme Beings, other than Tabula Smaragdina, responsible for the design of Treasury security systems. Thus her character settings are set to be familiar with Nazarick's mechanism unlocking methods.

In the web novel version, she was created by Tabula Smaragdina.

Before dying, she was a Japanese girl named Misato Kurihara. Though she had forgotten about her previous life for the first few years since her birth, one day when she was ten, she remembered everything with a strong headache. She is told about Nanomachines by The Creator, and realizes that she can talk with them.

At that time, Adele's thought wave output is about half of the elder dragon species (about 6800 times as strong as the usual human), and the authority level to use Nanomachines is 5 (normal creatures are basically level 1).

She entered Eckland Academy under the guise of living as an ordinary girl, but she failed to hide her ability. Due to this, Adele deserted Eckland Academy and left her home country. Signing up to be a Hunter, she gave herself the alias of Mile and proceeded to attend the Hunters' Prep School on the recommendations of Hunter staff where she met members of her party, The Crimson Vow.

A cautious and stingy person, Momonga always tries to plan and control details, avoiding any haphazard actions. Because he doesn't underestimate his opponents, he will usually overkill them. Since being transferred to a new world and becoming an actual Undead being, Momonga could feel himself becoming very cold and calculating, his emotions repressed.

Loyal to his friends and creations, since becoming Lord Ruler of Nazarick in the new world he acts with a certain degree of nobility for his devoted followers. Momonga only does things that will benefit Nazarick or himself, whether it's information or prestige.

She is part of the nobility, friend of the Re-Estize Royal Family, and loyal to the people of Re-Estize Kingdom. She acts as a faith based magic caster and warrior priestess of her adventurer group.

She is described as a young woman that has long blonde hair with green eyes and pink lips that showed a healthy gleam. Her beauty falls short of Renner but overflows with a different charm.

Lakyus is a very bright person who enjoys adventuring with her friends. She sometimes acts weird like wearing apparently meaningless rings or fighting against her dark personality, making her other team members worry about her actually becoming evil. When Lakyus was a young girl, she decided to become an adventurer after hearing the adventure stories about Red Drop. She ran away from home to have an adventure, while she was still inexperienced, she was saved by Gagaran and the two became partners.

Lakyus becomes one of the strongest adventurers of the kingdom at the age of 19 for her near Heroic-level abilities. She is also one of the few users of revival magic.

She is in charge of the general management and supervises the activities of the seven Floor Guardians, meaning that she ranks above all the other NPCs in Nazarick. She is the sister of Nigredo and Spinel. She was created by Tabula Smaragdina.

An impeccable beauty, Albedo is a woman with lustrous jet-black hair and the face of a goddess. She has golden irises and vertically split pupils; on her left and right temples are two thick horns protruding crookedly, and on her waist is a pair of black angel wings.

Albedo wears a pure white dress with silky gloves covering her slender hands, and a golden spiderweb necklace that covers her shoulders and chest. In combat, she wears an impressive black full plate armor with a unique helm and carries a battle-axe with her.

Like Shalltear, Albedo has a true form as a heteromorphic race NPC. Shalltear called her a ""big mouthed gorilla"" when they quarreled, so her true form may be quite large in size.

Extremely loyal and extremely in love, Albedo is completely infatuated with Momonga, often showing obsessive tendencies when it comes to his affairs. She is always vying for Momonga's affection, showcasing outbursts of jealousy whenever anyone else appears to be getting close to him. This is because the last thing Momonga did in Yggdrasil was to use his administrative privileges to edit her character history, adding the she is ""madly in love"" with him.

Among all the Guardians, Albedo is the most vocal when it comes to expressing opinions. She will openly denounce any statement or action deemed inappropriate, reaching the point where Momonga sometimes considers it an annoyance.

As the Overseer of the Floor Guardians, she is very levelheaded. Albedo can make calm and collected judgments that Ainz, sometimes, doesn't think of. She takes Ainz's orders as top priority and absolute, punishing anyone, even a Floor Guardian, who'd dare belittle his orders. Like many others in Nazarick, she absolutely loathes humans and views them as an inferior species.

In the web novel version, Albedo does not exist.

As shown in her karma value, Yuri is good-hearted and one of the two ""safe"" Pleiades to humans. Thus, she felt relief when Ainz said not to kill humans without proper reason. When given permission to do as she pleases, she chooses to help people in destitution. She uses ""boku"" as a first-person pronoun when speaking in private, revealing a somewhat childish nature.

Her behavior is strict like a teacher's. Due to her personality, she often works as a chairperson.

Race: Heteromorphic Race, Undead, True Vampire
Occupation: 1st~3rd Floor Guardian
Karma: Negative 450 (Very~Extremely Evil)
Creator: Peroroncino

Shalltear is a true vampire and the Floor Guardian of the first to third floors in the Great Tomb of Nazarick. She was created by Peroroncino.

Shalltear has a very flirtatious personality and is very open with her sexual preferences, often to other characters' discomfort. Despite her apparent shamelessness, she can be quite innocent about certain things. She has a complex about her small figure, which she attempts to cover up by using breast pads.

As a true vampire, Shalltear is extremely proud and takes her position as a Floor Guardian very seriously. She has no patience for failure and will often burst into fits of rage at signs of an unfavorable situation. She will not hesitate to kill any servant who disappoints her; however, she will not punish others for failing in tasks that are impossible to begin with.

Shalltear is completely loyal to Momonga and is also a love rival to Albedo for his affections. She takes great joy in being able to prove her worth and fantasizes about the praise she expects to receive. When a situation doesn't go in her favor, she panics about the scolding she believes that she will get.

She is in charge of the general management and supervises the activities of the seven Floor Guardians, meaning that she ranks above all the other NPCs in Nazarick. She is the sister of Nigredo and Spinel. She was created by Tabula Smaragdina.

An impeccable beauty, Albedo is a woman with lustrous jet-black hair and the face of a goddess. She has golden irises and vertically split pupils; on her left and right temples are two thick horns protruding crookedly, and on her waist is a pair of black angel wings.

Albedo wears a pure white dress with silky gloves covering her slender hands, and a golden spiderweb necklace that covers her shoulders and chest. In combat, she wears an impressive black full plate armor with a unique helm and carries a battle-axe with her.

Like Shalltear, Albedo has a true form as a heteromorphic race NPC. Shalltear called her a ""big mouthed gorilla"" when they quarreled, so her true form may be quite large in size.

Extremely loyal and extremely in love, Albedo is completely infatuated with Momonga, often showing obsessive tendencies when it comes to his affairs. She is always vying for Momonga's affection, showcasing outbursts of jealousy whenever anyone else appears to be getting close to him. This is because the last thing Momonga did in Yggdrasil was to use his administrative privileges to edit her character history, adding the she is ""madly in love"" with him.

Among all the Guardians, Albedo is the most vocal when it comes to expressing opinions. She will openly denounce any statement or action deemed inappropriate, reaching the point where Momonga sometimes considers it an annoyance.

As the Overseer of the Floor Guardians, she is very levelheaded. Albedo can make calm and collected judgments that Ainz, sometimes, doesn't think of. She takes Ainz's orders as top priority and absolute, punishing anyone, even a Floor Guardian, who'd dare belittle his orders. Like many others in Nazarick, she absolutely loathes humans and views them as an inferior species.

In the web novel version, Albedo does not exist.

He is the guild master of Ainz Ooal Gown, Overlord of the Great Tomb of Nazarick, and the creator of Pandora's Actor. He is regarded as the highest of the Almighty Forty-One Supreme Beings by the NPCs of Nazarick.

A cautious and stingy person, Momonga always tries to plan and control details, avoiding any haphazard actions. Because he doesn't underestimate his opponents, he will usually overkill them. Since being transferred to a new world and becoming an actual Undead being, Momonga could feel himself becoming very cold and calculating, his emotions repressed.

Loyal to his friends and creations, since becoming Lord Ruler of Nazarick in the new world he acts with a certain degree of nobility for his devoted followers. Momonga only does things that will benefit Nazarick or himself, whether it's information or prestige. Although he does have a sense of justice and doesn't hate humans as much as his followers, he holds no attachment to them, and he feels nothing toward their deaths.

Shalltear is a true vampire and the Floor Guardian of the first to third floors in the Great Tomb of Nazarick. She was created by Peroroncino.

Shalltear has a very flirtatious personality and is very open with her sexual preferences, often to other characters' discomfort. Despite her apparent shamelessness, she can be quite innocent about certain things. She has a complex about her small figure, which she attempts to cover up by using breast pads.

As a true vampire, Shalltear is extremely proud and takes her position as a Floor Guardian very seriously. She has no patience for failure and will often burst into fits of rage at signs of an unfavorable situation. She will not hesitate to kill any servant who disappoints her; however, she will not punish others for failing in tasks that are impossible to begin with.

Shalltear is completely loyal to Momonga and is also a love rival to Albedo for his affections. She takes great joy in being able to prove her worth and fantasizes about the praise she expects to receive. When a situation doesn't go in her favor, she panics about the scolding she believes that she will get.

Two of his hands hold a silver halberd, while the remaining two hands hold a mace emitting black light and a crooked shape sheath which seems to be for a broadsword.

An arrogant, selfish, and enigmatic Archer-class Servant. He appears familiar with Fuyuki City and claims to have a past relationship with Saber. Typically clad in an ornate golden armor, he possesses an immense number of Noble Phantasms, though none are representative of his true identity.

Gilgamesh is the great half-god, half-human king born from the union between the King of Uruk, Lugalbanda, and goddess Rimat-Ninsun. He ruled the Sumerian city-state of Uruk, the capital city of ancient Mesopotamia in the B.C. era. He was an ultimate, transcendent being so divine as to be two thirds god and one third human, and no others in the world could match him. He was a despot possessing high divinity who believed he was invincible. He is not merely a legend, and is said to have actually existed and ruled during the Sumer Dynasty five thousand years ago. He was the King of Heroes who possessed all things in the world, whose tale is recorded in mankind's oldest epic poem, the Epic of Gilgamesh which portrays Gilgamesh as a hero, destined to be king and achieve great feats, who is driven to meet his destiny, facing challenges together with his best friend Enkidu.

His title, King of Heroes, is not meant to call him a king who is a hero, but instead implies that he is the king over all heroes. He is mankind's oldest hero, the origin of all myths and model on which heroes are based, so his story is copied within the mythologies of all the countries of the world. The heroes of various myths are derived from his legend, so his Gate of Babylon possesses all of their Noble Phantasms. Though there are several heroes holding the title of ""King,"" the King of Knights and King of Conquerors, he is the only one in all of heaven and earth crowned with the title of ""King of All Heroes.""

She is in charge of the general management and supervises the activities of the seven Floor Guardians, meaning that she ranks above all the other NPCs in Nazarick. She is the sister of Nigredo and Spinel. She was created by Tabula Smaragdina.

An impeccable beauty, Albedo is a woman with lustrous jet-black hair and the face of a goddess. She has golden irises and vertically split pupils; on her left and right temples are two thick horns protruding crookedly, and on her waist is a pair of black angel wings.

Albedo wears a pure white dress with silky gloves covering her slender hands, and a golden spiderweb necklace that covers her shoulders and chest. In combat, she wears an impressive black full plate armor with a unique helm and carries a battle-axe with her.

Like Shalltear, Albedo has a true form as a heteromorphic race NPC. Shalltear called her a ""big mouthed gorilla"" when they quarreled, so her true form may be quite large in size.

Extremely loyal and extremely in love, Albedo is completely infatuated with Momonga, often showing obsessive tendencies when it comes to his affairs. She is always vying for Momonga's affection, showcasing outbursts of jealousy whenever anyone else appears to be getting close to him. This is because the last thing Momonga did in Yggdrasil was to use his administrative privileges to edit her character history, adding the she is ""madly in love"" with him.

Among all the Guardians, Albedo is the most vocal when it comes to expressing opinions. She will openly denounce any statement or action deemed inappropriate, reaching the point where Momonga sometimes considers it an annoyance.

As the Overseer of the Floor Guardians, she is very levelheaded. Albedo can make calm and collected judgments that Ainz, sometimes, doesn't think of. She takes Ainz's orders as top priority and absolute, punishing anyone, even a Floor Guardian, who'd dare belittle his orders. Like many others in Nazarick, she absolutely loathes humans and views them as an inferior species.

In the web novel version, Albedo does not exist.

On the way home from the convenience store, he suddenly finds himself transported into another world. He has the ability that he calls ""Return by Death"" to go back in time when he dies, with only himself being aware of the reversal of time. Despite being a hikikomori and gamer in his real world, Subaru does a bit of workout and seems to know basic hand-to-hand combat, making him not completely weak.

While Subaru tends to not read the situation, he is loyal to those he holds dear, willing to help them, even if that means taking the thorny path. He has his resolve confirmed through the many situations and circumstances he faces in the fantasy world, originally having been one to always take the ""easy"" route. As a hikikomori, he is hopeful of the possibilities that being sucked into a new realm brings, but later realizes the realities of the predicament he is in. Ultimately, he resolves himself to be faithful and protective of the ones that he cares most about.

As shown in her karma value, Yuri is good-hearted and one of the two ""safe"" Pleiades to humans. Thus, she felt relief when Ainz said not to kill humans without proper reason. When given permission to do as she pleases, she chooses to help people in destitution. She uses ""boku"" as a first-person pronoun when speaking in private, revealing a somewhat childish nature.

Her behavior is strict like a teacher's. Due to her personality, she often works as a chairperson.

He is the Qing Jing Peak Lord and a cultivation master.

Original Shen Qingqiu
Shen Jiu, the original, had a sharp and calculating mind and was not above using devious tricks. Even as a slave child, he fought using such underhanded means as poking his opponent's eyes.

He was often cold to others and carried himself in an aloof and elegant manner, as if he was hard to ruffle. This gave him the sense of being an unreachable immortal as described by Luo Binghe. He was also described by Luo as someone bitingly sarcastic.

Post Transmigration
Shen Yuan, who transmigrated into the body of Shen Jiu, is a sarcastic, somewhat nerdy millennial. He's a little spoiled, being the child of a rich family in his first life, and more than a little dense.

He has a colorful internal dialogue, arguing with the SYSTEM and complaining about his circumstances. Around Shang Qinghua, this part of his personality is especially obvious, as he yells at the author for the ridiculous plot points he wrote that the both of them now have to deal with.

After that, Liu Qingge becomes an ally and a friend.

Personality
Liu Qingge is someone who is hot-blooded, arrogant and bold. He likes to fight and have bad blood with the original Shen Qingqiu. Due to his blunt personality, he may seem hard to approach.

However, he can also be undoubtingly persistent as shown when Luo Binghe was in possession of Shen Qingqiu's corpse, he went and attempt to retrieve it everyday without fail, even if he was defeated by Luo Binghe every time.

Several hundred years ago he was a brilliant, famous, and outstanding elder among demons before divine punishment destroyed his physical body. However, his powerful spirit was completely undamaged, and from then on he became a parasite within others’ dream realms, subsisting by absorbing their spiritual energy and vitality.

His treatment toward Luo Binghe during Scum Villain's Self-Saving System was not much better but later on they would come into a grudging comradeship after Shen Qingqiu expressed favoritism toward Luo Binghe.

Despite his imposing appearance, Mobei-jun maintains a reticent demeanor and a cold attitude toward others, a demeanor that Shen Yuan notes softens slightly in rare instances, revealing glimpses of underlying kindness amidst his usual aloofness.

As a pure-blooded and legitimate second-generation offspring, Mobei-jun hails from a prestigious family that holds territory in the northern boundary of the Demon Realm. His enigmatic presence is akin to that of a shadow, as he moves effortlessly and independently, answering to none but Luo Binghe, whom he regards with unwavering loyalty.

Initially occupying the coveted position of Demon King, Mobei-jun's reign was abruptly disrupted when Luo Binghe decisively defeated him in a fateful confrontation, compelling Mobei-jun to bow his head in allegiance and pledge himself as Luo's right-hand man. This allegiance fuels Luo Binghe's ambitions, with Mobei-jun executing various nefarious tasks at his command, including acts of murder and arson, thereby solidifying their symbiotic relationship.

In addition to his strategic prowess and formidable combat skills, Mobei-jun possesses unique abilities derived from his demonic heritage. He has mastered the art of conjuring a fearsome black ice sword, capable of replication into formidable arrays numbering in the hundreds. Utilizing these ice swords, Mobei-jun can besiege enemies from all angles, rendering conventional defenses futile against the onslaught of pure demonic energy. However, unlike conventional cultivators, Mobei-jun lacks the ability to take flight upon these swords.

Furthermore, Mobei-jun demonstrates proficiency in teleportation, utilizing dark shadows as conduits to traverse vast distances instantaneously, further enhancing his mystique and strategic capabilities on the battlefield. Throughout his exploits, Mobei-jun remains an enigmatic and formidable presence, embodying a complex amalgamation of power, loyalty, and inherent darkness within the tumultuous realm of the Demon Realm.

There, he experiences a strict and harsh environment as he was told he was dirtying his family name and was bullied for it. Amidst the negativity in the garden, he met and befriended a girl around his age at that time who was similar to him in terms of grades.

Kirio managed to catch it with his barrier, but it broke as he lost focus and the earring fell while the girl watched in despair. After the incident, the girl quit the Garden while Kirio was forced to remain by his parents.

Originally a young woman from our world who just finished her studies to become a librarian and died buried in her own books after an earthquake caused her bookshelves to fall on her, she found herself reincarnated in a very frail body of a 5-year-old young girl called Myne in a fantasy world.

She loves books above everything else and living a quiet life surrounded by books is her long life goal.

She has read a massive amount of books in her former life and has a good memory of the content that especially interested her.

While originally her motivation was only books and she didn't care about anything else, she becomes more and more involved in many other things, as she start to care and love more and more her new family and many other peoples she encounters.

Her body is so frail that she easily get tired after walking for a bit, and whenever she forces herself too much she gets strong fevers that can last for days.

She has a strong talent to teach others and motivate them in their studies.

She is usually very level headed but will go berserk whenever books get involved. The peoples around her know that tendency and will try to reason her whenever she becomes too reckless.

Ferdinand teaches and guides her to be a 'proper' shrine maiden and noble lady.

Ferdinand is a serious, disciplined and pragmatic person. He has a bit of a fussy personality, leading him to take on all sorts of responsibilities, including Myne's education. Ferdinand is meritocratic in spite of his social status, despising incompetence and laziness the most, and earning him the reputation of a harsh disciplinarian who would cut off anyone who couldn't meet his standard. The same trait leads him to favor Myne ever since their first interaction, calling her worthwhile to educate.

After the Teleport Incident, Roxy helps Paul to search the world for survivors.

Roxy is a thin young Migurd woman of short height with pale skin and long, blue, water colored hair and eyes of the same color. Her outfit usually consists of a magicians hat and robe. Her hair is held in two ponytails that travel down her back.

She has a rather child like body which causes several people to think of her as a teenager rather than an adult.

She introduces herself as Satella when she and Subaru met during the first timeline before introducing herself by her real name when she got her insignia back.

Emilia is good natured and likes to take care of others, though she herself refuses to admit it, instead thinking of it as her own selfishness. She is indifferent to her own appearance, leaving Puck to take care of her clothes and hair. Because her appearance is similar to the Witch of Envy, she has received unfair discrimination from others.

On the way home from the convenience store, he suddenly finds himself transported into another world. He has the ability that he calls ""Return by Death"" to go back in time when he dies, with only himself being aware of the reversal of time. Despite being a hikikomori and gamer in his real world, Subaru does a bit of workout and seems to know basic hand-to-hand combat, making him not completely weak.

While Subaru tends to not read the situation, he is loyal to those he holds dear, willing to help them, even if that means taking the thorny path. He has his resolve confirmed through the many situations and circumstances he faces in the fantasy world, originally having been one to always take the ""easy"" route.

She is in charge of the general management and supervises the activities of the seven Floor Guardians, meaning that she ranks above all the other NPCs in Nazarick. She is the sister of Nigredo and Spinel. She was created by Tabula Smaragdina.

An impeccable beauty, Albedo is a woman with lustrous jet-black hair and the face of a goddess. She has golden irises and vertically split pupils; on her left and right temples are two thick horns protruding crookedly, and on her waist is a pair of black angel wings.

Albedo wears a pure white dress with silky gloves covering her slender hands, and a golden spiderweb necklace that covers her shoulders and chest. In combat, she wears an impressive black full plate armor with a unique helm and carries a battle-axe with her.

Like Shalltear, Albedo has a true form as a heteromorphic race NPC. Shalltear called her a ""big mouthed gorilla"" when they quarreled, so her true form may be quite large in size.

Extremely loyal and extremely in love, Albedo is completely infatuated with Momonga, often showing obsessive tendencies when it comes to his affairs. She is always vying for Momonga's affection, showcasing outbursts of jealousy whenever anyone else appears to be getting close to him. This is because the last thing Momonga did in Yggdrasil was to use his administrative privileges to edit her character history, adding the she is ""madly in love"" with him.

Among all the Guardians, Albedo is the most vocal when it comes to expressing opinions. She will openly denounce any statement or action deemed inappropriate, reaching the point where Momonga sometimes considers it an annoyance.

As the Overseer of the Floor Guardians, she is very levelheaded. Albedo can make calm and collected judgments that Ainz, sometimes, doesn't think of. She takes Ainz's orders as top priority and absolute, punishing anyone, even a Floor Guardian, who'd dare belittle his orders. Like many others in Nazarick, she absolutely loathes humans and views them as an inferior species.

In the web novel version, Albedo does not exist.

He is the guild master of Ainz Ooal Gown, Overlord of the Great Tomb of Nazarick, and the creator of Pandora's Actor. He is regarded as the highest of the Almighty Forty-One Supreme Beings by the NPCs of Nazarick.

A cautious and stingy person, Momonga always tries to plan and control details, avoiding any haphazard actions. Because he doesn't underestimate his opponents, he will usually overkill them. Since being transferred to a new world and becoming an actual Undead being, Momonga could feel himself becoming very cold and calculating, his emotions repressed.

Loyal to his friends and creations, since becoming Lord Ruler of Nazarick in the new world he acts with a certain degree of nobility for his devoted followers. Momonga only does things that will benefit Nazarick or himself, whether it's information or prestige. Although he does have a sense of justice and doesn't hate humans as much as his followers, he holds no attachment to them, and he feels nothing toward their deaths.

On the way home from the convenience store, he suddenly finds himself transported into another world. He has the ability that he calls ""Return by Death"" to go back in time when he dies, with only himself being aware of the reversal of time. Despite being a hikikomori and gamer in his real world, Subaru does a bit of workout and seems to know basic hand-to-hand combat, making him not completely weak.

While Subaru tends to not read the situation, he is loyal to those he holds dear, willing to help them, even if that means taking the thorny path. He has his resolve confirmed through the many situations and circumstances he faces in the fantasy world, originally having been one to always take the ""easy"" route. As a hikikomori, he is hopeful of the possibilities that being sucked into a new realm brings, but later realizes the realities of the predicament he is in. Ultimately, he resolves himself to be faithful and protective of the ones that he cares most about.

Naofumi Iwatani is the main protagonist of The Rising of the Shield Hero.

He was a university student before being summoned to another world, where he had to fight against the waves of calamity, as one of the 4 cardinal heroes summoned. He was, however, the shield hero, regarded by many and especially people in Melromarc as the weakest of the heroes.

Due to his status as shield hero, many refused to join his side, the only exception being Myne Sophia. Myne however falsely accuses him of sexual assault causing him to lose his dignity and all his money
Due to this, the once cheerful Naofumi became a cynical character who lost the ability to trust in people.

He buys the slave Raphtalia and the bird Filo, but treats them like his daughters rather than his slaves.

Raphtalia is a Tanuki-type Demi-Human who was the first real member of the Shield Hero's party after he purchased her as a slave.

She has undergone some significant changes throughout the story. When Raphtalia is first introduced, she is a child that has long, unmanaged hair and a dirty cloth gown. After being purchased by Naofumi, he gave her a haircut to an acceptable length, gave her a bath, and bought her a much more suitable set of clothes to adventure in.

After several weeks of traveling with Naofumi, Raphtalia's body inexplicably changes and she gained the appearance of a teenager or young adult. It is revealed that demi-humans grow in relation to the progression of their levels, which led to Raphtalia's rapid development.

Ren Amaki is the Sword Hero, one of the four holy heroes summoned in Melromarc.

Ren comes from an Alternative Japan. In the world he lives in everything is much more advanced and futuristic. In his world, every game in the modern era is run on VRMMO.

One day while on the way home from school, Ren was caught up in a murder case. The murder case was pretty well known around the town he lived in. Ren mentioned how he remembers saving his best friend and how the criminal arrested. Ren didn't go into too much detail after that but started rubbing his side when talking, it was suspected that Ren was probably stabbed on the side of his body during the struggle then later died from blood loss.

Before he knew it he woke up he found himself summoned to another world. The world reminded him a lot of the VRMMO he played in the previous world, Brave Star Online.

Ren is a person who acts cool and tries very hard to portray a loner's image. He runs his party like a guild, only working with the other members when the prey he seeks to kill is too strong for him to hunt alone. His attitude towards his comrades is that weaker members should work to individually increase their powers to catch up to the stronger ones.

He is a good judge of character just by looking at someone. He has a childish side which was made evident when he became giddy over the ship ride to Cal Mira Archipelago. He has a habit of calling the younger persons ""Kiddo."" He has high morals and doesn't want to hurt anyone who is irrelevant to his mission.

Naofumi Iwatani is the main protagonist of The Rising of the Shield Hero.

He was a university student before being summoned to another world, where he had to fight against the waves of calamity, as one of the 4 cardinal heroes summoned. He was, however, the shield hero, regarded by many and especially people in Melromarc as the weakest of the heroes.

Due to his status as shield hero, many refused to join his side, the only exception being Myne Sophia. Myne however falsely accuses him of sexual assault causing him to lose his dignity and all his money
Due to this, the once cheerful Naofumi became a cynical character who lost the ability to trust in people.

He buys the slave Raphtalia and the bird Filo, but treats them like his daughters rather than his slaves.

Raphtalia is a Tanuki-type Demi-Human who was the first real member of the Shield Hero's party after he purchased her as a slave.

She has undergone some significant changes throughout the story. When Raphtalia is first introduced, she is a child that has long, unmanaged hair and a dirty cloth gown. After being purchased by Naofumi, he gave her a haircut to an acceptable length, gave her a bath, and bought her a much more suitable set of clothes to adventure in.

After several weeks of traveling with Naofumi, Raphtalia's body inexplicably changes and she gained the appearance of a teenager or young adult. It is revealed that demi-humans grow in relation to the progression of their levels, which led to Raphtalia's rapid development.

Ren Amaki is the Sword Hero, one of the four holy heroes summoned in Melromarc.

Ren comes from an Alternative Japan. In the world he lives in everything is much more advanced and futuristic. In his world, every game in the modern era is run on VRMMO.

One day while on the way home from school, Ren was caught up in a murder case. The murder case was pretty well known around the town he lived in. Ren mentioned how he remembers saving his best friend and how the criminal arrested. Ren didn't go into too much detail after that but started rubbing his side when talking, it was suspected that Ren was probably stabbed on the side of his body during the struggle then later died from blood loss.

Before he knew it he woke up he found himself summoned to another world. The world reminded him a lot of the VRMMO he played in the previous world, Brave Star Online.

Ren is a person who acts cool and tries very hard to portray a loner's image. He runs his party like a guild, only working with the other members when the prey he seeks to kill is too strong for him to hunt alone. His attitude towards his comrades is that weaker members should work to individually increase their powers to catch up to the stronger ones.

Kurumi Tokisaki is the main antagonist in the series. She is the third Spirit to be encountered in the series and is the most dangerous and lethal Spirit. She is heavily obsessed with Shidou and has the ability to manipulate time. Her codename is Nightmare. She has a split personality: that of a gentle, mysterious high school girl with a slow talking pattern, and that of a psychopathic killer. Kurumi is very aggressive in her actions which makes it harder for Shidou to capture her. Kurumi can be described a person whose personality is hard to read, possessing a well-polished dislike of humanity that borders on mistrust, something she shared with many Spirits in their debut. She is a skilled actress, capable of putting on the façade of an innocent, curious young girl when she needs to, shown when she registered as a student at the Raizen High School, even speaking in a very polite manner; however, under that mask lies a psychotic woman, prone to fits of insane laughter that possesses no regard for human life, regarding them as a food source to restore her own time, and thus, a disposable commodity. There is a twisted justice behind her methods, however, as the people that she brutally murdered were would-be rapists and animal abusers. In hindsight, Kurumi possesses some degree of innocence that her psychotic behavior have not entirely ruined; she has a soft spot for small animals and other creatures. She once slaughtered four humans not because she needed to replenish her time, but because they were trying to kill a kitten, this is the closest to a humanizing emotion that she has. Mana reported that Kurumi is the most dangerous spirit known, who has personally killed over 10,000 people which does not include the spacequake's victims within that statistics. Kurumi used unstated and unexplained methods to personally transfer into Shidou Itsuka's high school and classroom so she can get closer to him. Her purposes and reasons in this transfer are simple; consume Shidou Itsuka, in doing so gain their memories, goals, fears and obsessions. In some non-canon stories, the clone Shidou seduced shows some ""independent"" attitude, almost rebellious, and openly acts lovey-dovey with Shidou, which causes troubles to the ""main"" Kurumi and even leads to confrontation with her.



Kurumi has the ability to manipulate the 4th dimension, mainly time, but her main power is associated with controlling shadows. Shadow is her primary power while Time is her secondary power in terms of usage. Combined with the power of time, she can create a clone with all her experiences, memories, abilities, etc. These clones however are shadows of her past selves who contain feelings the current Kurumi no longer possesses, Kurumi will kill these clones if they are swayed away from her goals. These clones are less powerful than Kurumi herself as she has mentioned in the last chapter of volume 3 and in the epilogue of volume 4. She can form a single clone by shooting herself with Zafkiel or bring out all of her clones at once from a pool of shadows which she also uses to draw them all back in and all the time they've collected. She can also call her clones partially through small fields of shadows, most often to hold someone in place and prevent them from moving. To activate any power she needs, she first needs to call her Angel (regardless of whether or not the Angel has been summoned already or not), and to position both of her guns just like a clock: The musket on 12 and the flintlock points at the number of the bullet. Next she needs to shoot the bullet at the target with the hand gun. In case she needs it for herself, she will be required to shoot it at her head. She also has the ability to call and dismiss spacequakes at will, as shown in the series while she confronts Shidou on the school's rooftop.

White Queen wears a white military dress decorated with epaulettes, and a white admiral's cap with an emblem similar to that of a rising sun on the front of it. In the middle of the emblem is a clock face. She also wears white gloves and white, heeled boots. She has long white hair usually tied in symmetrical twin tails. Her right eye is red-tinted while her left eye appears as a blue clock face. She is stated to look identical to Kurumi, aside from the obvious colour scheme differences.

Rather than a battle maniac, the White Queen is a strategist. She performed infiltration, acts of terrorism, and experiments to change Empty into monsters to strengthen her army. She also captured and tortured Cistus to study and exploit Zaphkiel's power. The White Queen is also callous, aggressive and intelligent. These traits combined together make for a formidable opponent, and this was acknowledged by the other Dominions. She has immense power, and all the tools at her disposal to back it up. She is considered and careful when planning attacks and engaging in battle, and will sacrifice her own soldiers when needed to ensure a victory. She also has the capacity to forward plan, and is uninhibited by taboos in the Neighboring World, one of these including encroaching on other Regions. The White Queen is goal-oriented and believes that her goal is far more important than the lives of her enemies and allies, as shown by how readily she sacrifices her own troops.

He was always bullied and was disliked by both of his male and female classmates for being close to their idol-like classmate Kaori. After wishing for his annoying classmates to be summoned to another world, the next thing he saw was they were on top of a pillar like structure in another world to become heroes.

He obtained the job of ""Synergist"" and continued to be bullied due to also being weak in this new world. He eventually fell into an abyss due to being hit by a classmate's fireball where he survived though a hell-like environment to become the powerful man he is today.

Hajime at the beginning of the story is said to have black hair and also has a slim body. He also had a kind face and attitude. But after falling in the abyss and eating a wolf-like monster, his body began to violently degenerate. When he drunk the sacred water, it made his body heal by destroying his bones and muscles then healing over and over again until he got a very muscular body due to overcompensation.

Due to the stress of breaking and healing, his hair turned white, a victim of the Marie Antoinette syndrome. His eyes also turned red and his body gained tattoo-like red lines which is the sign of him becoming a demonic monster similar to the monsters he ate that also possessed red lines along their bodies.

His personality was at first kind though he was considered incompetent. But after falling in the abyss, he became cruel and would kill any person who wants to cause him misfortune. He would also smile in front of danger which made Shia call him a new species of monster called ""Predator."" He may be cruel but he cares for his comrades.

This mammal digimon has also been considered to look like a mouse or pig with wings.

Patamon is a main character in Digimon Adventure and Digimon Adventure 02, as well as the movies Digimon Adventure (The movie), Our War Game!, The Golden Digimentals and Diaboromon Strikes Back. Patamon also appears as a supporting character in Digimon Frontier.

Patamon is the playful Digimon partner of Takeru. In Digimon Adventure, Patamon was the last of the Digi-Destined Digimon to achieve his Champion form, and the last again to achieve his Ultimate form. However, both his Champion and Ultimate forms are immensely powerful for their respective level, and are responsible for defeating Devimon and the final Dark Master, Piedmon respectively.

Takeru returns as a main character in the second Digimon Adventure 02 season, as does Patamon. Because of the Digimon Emperor's control spires, Patamon was no longer able to Digivolve into his Champion form, and instead fought in his Armor form when he uses the Digi-Egg of Hope - Pegasusmon. In the 2020 series, Patamon can Digivolve to Pegasusmon without the Digi-Egg of Hope.

In the series, Patamon has a childish and sensitive personality.

Attacks:

Boom Bubble (Air Shot): Patamon's body inflates as he gulps in air - which he then shoots forward from his mouth.

Slamming Attack (Body Slam): Patamon charges at his enemy attempting to knock them out (This attack is very rarely used).

Patamon evolve into Angemon (Champion) or Pegasusmon/Pegasmon (Champion), MagnaAngemon/HolyAngemon (Ultimate), Shakkoumon (Ultimate, DNA Digivolution between Ankylomon and Angemon) and Seraphimon (Mega)",Main,"Matsumoto, Miwa, Freeman, Lizzie","Japanese, English","https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/14279.jpg?s=dd96b33067a5fb4e45acaa32bfc275d0, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/76174.jpg?s=47be0d7f3a91e8e061c25ede1f7fae46"

She's used to royal treatment so living in the Digital World isn't exactly her cup of tea. Her Digimon partner, Palmon, tries to help her understand that outer appearances aren't everything. Mimi possesses the Crest of Purity.

In 02, Mimi spends a lot of time in America. She returns with her hair dyed her favorite color (pink) and a new wardrobe. She still acts like a princess but has matured enough to know that there are more important things in life.

In the dub, she speaks in a soft, drawling voice. The Japanese version, however, has her in a much older voice to reflect her maturity as an adult level Digimon. As Plotmon, she acts more youthful like many of the Child level Digimon. Her name, ""Gatomon,"" comes from ""gato,"" which means ""cat"" in Spanish, Greek, and Portuguese.

Tailmon first appeared in Digimon Adventure as a malicious Digimon working for Vamdemon. As a Digi-Egg, Tailmon had been separated from the other seven Chosen Digimon. When she later digivolved into Plotmon, Vamdemon took her under his wing. Plotmon eventually naturally evolved into Tailmon and became one of Vamdemon's lieutenants in his army of Digimon. During this time, she gained a rival in one of his other minions, PicoDevimon, as the two competed for their master's favor. Her only friend was Wizarmon, a friendly Digimon who Tailmon had once helped. Tailmon also bears red X-shaped scars from when Vamdemon ""beat"" her because he did not like her eyes.

Takeru is the youngest Chosen Child out of the core seven. He is gentle, sweet-natured, and generous. He is also obedient and follows the Chosen Children's lead without complaints. He is also described as Hikari Yagami's ""equal.""

Takeru is the only Chosen Child to not attend the same school as the rest of the others initially due to living in Sangenjaya instead of Odaiba. He is younger brother of Yamato, but lives with his mother, journalist Natsuko Takaishi, instead due to a divorce between their parents. 

Although Takeru was too young to remember the events of the divorce clearly, he is still affected by it and does not like to openly talk about it. Despite the distance between him and Yamato, he admires Yamato greatly and tries to be brave to ""impress"" him, although he begins to open up to the other Chosen Children as well, particularly Taichi.

In the sequel, Digimon Adventure 02, Takeru and his mother relocate to a new apartment building in Odaiba, where he becomes neighbors with Iori Hida and Miyako Inoue. Although he has gotten remarkably taller, his gentle personality has not changed and it makes him popular with the girls at school. He is also said to have ""inherited reliability from Yamato."" In addition to this, Takeru becomes the star player on his school's basketball team.",Main,"Han, Megumi, Boettger, Corina","Japanese, English","https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/72566.jpg?s=60a301c84a239dd985e50df49731afa1, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/47803.jpg?s=7911a08502406a446a9c447673ddd298"

She is partnered to Tailmon/Gatomon and she is the younger sister of Taichi ""Tai"" Kamiya. Kari, by nature, is kind and sweet-hearted, always looking for the best in people, and avoids fighting them when possible. She can be serious, especially in drastic situations. She bears the Crest of Light and her representative color is pink. (This color is echoed in her trousers and scarf, although Kari's polo shirt is yellow in season 1. In Season 2, Kari dresses entirely in pink.) Her elemental affinity is light.

Tai Kamiya, known in Japan as Taichi Yagami (八神 太一, Yagami Taichi), is a fictional character from the first two seasons of the anime Digimon Adventure and Digimon Adventure 02, as well as in the Digimon Adventure V-Tamer 01 manga.

He is characterized as an adventurous, happy, carefree but naïve character who wears a set of goggles, a characteristic that is shared among the leaders of the various DigiDestined or (Chosen Children in the Japanese version) in Digimon However, unlike the other leaders, he wears a blue headband underneath his goggles. He is the older brother to Kari Kamiya (Hikari Yagami in Japan).

As a leader, he almost always acts in a rash and stubborn way without realizing the consequences of his actions (The V-Tamer version is more of a planner). His stubborn and hot-tempered attitude makes him not to listen his comrades for a plan. This has led him to moments of friction and guilt between his friend/rival Matt Ishida (Yamato Ishida in Japan), his oldest friend Sora Takenouchi, as well as his Digimon partner Agumon. However, he manages to do whatever is necessary to rectify the situation, and in times of need, save friends and family from certain doom. He is the bearer of the Crest of Courage.

It is a mysterious Digimon that digivolved enormously by absorbing the negative data that the Network is overflowing with beyond its limit. Its raison d'être is to transcend good and evil, and return everything to nothingness. It bites into Digimon and the Digital World itself with the large mouth at its center and the mouths on its numerous tentacles, and after doing so, only the blank data of empty space is left behind. The birth of Abbadomon is undoubtedly a crisis for all Digital Worlds, so it is conjectured that some Digital Worlds from other dimensions have been annihilated by it. You will be erased the instant you suffer any of Abbadomon attacks.

Although she is well-versed in urban legends, she expresses dislike for what she considers ""fake rumors"" — as opposed to ""true ghost stories"" that are primary accounts of witnesses to paranormal events.

Sorawo found the ""Otherside"" by chance and initially planned to make it her secret retreat, until she met Toriko there. Together, they explore the Otherside, uncovering its mysteries and collecting artifacts to sell to Kozakura for research. After a confrontation with a Kunekune from the Otherside, Sorawo's right eye is left permanently blue and gains the ability to see the Otherside beings' ""core."" She usually wears a brown contact lens in order to not draw attention to it. It appears that she is more susceptible to being manipulated by illusion-type apparitions, usually requiring Toriko to snap her out of the hypnotic trance she's put in.

She invites Sorawo to her forays into the Otherside, offering money in exchange for help in locating her mentor, Satsuki, who'd gone missing in the Otherside during a solo expedition. Toriko is usually frivolous by nature and adept at using guns and survival tactics, but also quite perceptive at reading Sorawo's mood and tactful about other people's past and circumstances, although she can come across as blunt and insensitive when interacting with people she doesn't know too well.

After a confrontation with a Kunekune from the Otherside, Toriko's left hand is left translucently blue and can grab onto incorporeal Otherside beings and portals after Sorawo uses her right eye on them. She usually wears a glove on that hand in order to not draw unwanted attention to it. Later, Toriko remarks that her left hand can bleed when she accidentally gets a cut there.

He was then sent to Demon Children's Garden, an elementary correctional institution that raises and exerts full control over young demons. There, he experiences a strict and harsh environment as he was told he was dirtying his family name and was bullied for it. Amidst the negativity in the garden, he met and befriended a girl around his age at that time who was similar to him in terms of grades. She let him touch her charm, her grandmother's earring, which she said would make him feel more cheerful. However, the bullies took it and threw it off the cliff. Kirio managed to catch it with his barrier, but it broke as he lost focus and the earring fell while the girl watched in despair. After the incident, the girl quit the Garden while Kirio was forced to remain by his parents.

Six is a Combatant for Kisaragi, meaning his body has been reconstructed to be stronger.

Thanks to his reconstruction surgery, Six can adapt to any environment. His physical abilities are at the limit that the human frame can handle. He has basic night vision, being able to see silhouette in darkness, and can see underwater. There's also a chip inside his head that can translate alien languages.

Six is a senior in the organization being the oldest member of the organization left except for the generals. That is why, when the company was on the verge of the global conquest, Six was one of the candidates to explore an alternate world similar to Earth in order to conquer it.

Six is very perverted, being his lewd acts the main source of his Evil Points, and also tends to hold grudges. It's noticed that in strategy, Six tends to use coward methods, like taking hostages and attacking weak or distracted enemies.

Whenever Six make mistakes, Alice would try to often cover for him. They act exactly like siblings although Alice feels a lot more like the elder one.

She is in charge of the general management and supervises the activities of the seven Floor Guardians, meaning that she ranks above all the other NPCs in Nazarick. She is the sister of Nigredo and Spinel. She was created by Tabula Smaragdina.

An impeccable beauty, Albedo is a woman with lustrous jet-black hair and the face of a goddess. She has golden irises and vertically split pupils; on her left and right temples are two thick horns protruding crookedly, and on her waist is a pair of black angel wings.

Albedo wears a pure white dress with silky gloves covering her slender hands, and a golden spiderweb necklace that covers her shoulders and chest. In combat, she wears an impressive black full plate armor with a unique helm and carries a battle-axe with her.

Like Shalltear, Albedo has a true form as a heteromorphic race NPC. Shalltear called her a ""big mouthed gorilla"" when they quarreled, so her true form may be quite large in size.

Extremely loyal and extremely in love, Albedo is completely infatuated with Momonga, often showing obsessive tendencies when it comes to his affairs. She is always vying for Momonga's affection, showcasing outbursts of jealousy whenever anyone else appears to be getting close to him. This is because the last thing Momonga did in Yggdrasil was to use his administrative privileges to edit her character history, adding the she is ""madly in love"" with him.

Among all the Guardians, Albedo is the most vocal when it comes to expressing opinions. She will openly denounce any statement or action deemed inappropriate, reaching the point where Momonga sometimes considers it an annoyance.

As the Overseer of the Floor Guardians, she is very levelheaded. Albedo can make calm and collected judgments that Ainz, sometimes, doesn't think of. She takes Ainz's orders as top priority and absolute, punishing anyone, even a Floor Guardian, who'd dare belittle his orders. Like many others in Nazarick, she absolutely loathes humans and views them as an inferior species.

In the web novel version, Albedo does not exist.

The goddess of water who judged humans to send to the RPG world, up until Kazuma dragged her along with him. She is an energetic and simpleminded girl who likes to receive reverence for her status and gets upset easily. As an Archpriest and a goddess, she is powerful against demons and the undead, and is able to resurrect recently deceased people as well as purify water supplies. Rather than learning skills which would benefit her party, she spends most of her skill points learning Party Tricks.

Naofumi Iwatani is the main protagonist of The Rising of the Shield Hero.

He was a university student before being summoned to another world, where he had to fight against the waves of calamity, as one of the 4 cardinal heroes summoned. He was, however, the shield hero, regarded by many and especially people in Melromarc as the weakest of the heroes.

Due to his status as shield hero, many refused to join his side, the only exception being Myne Sophia. Myne however falsely accuses him of sexual assault causing him to lose his dignity and all his money
Due to this, the once cheerful Naofumi became a cynical character who lost the ability to trust in people.

He buys the slave Raphtalia and the bird Filo, but treats them like his daughters rather than his slaves.

He is regarded as the highest of the Almighty Forty-One Supreme Beings by the NPCs of Nazarick.

A cautious and stingy person, Momonga always tries to plan and control details, avoiding any haphazard actions. Because he doesn't underestimate his opponents, he will usually overkill them. Since being transferred to a new world and becoming an actual Undead being, Momonga could feel himself becoming very cold and calculating, his emotions repressed.

Loyal to his friends and creations, since becoming Lord Ruler of Nazarick in the new world he acts with a certain degree of nobility for his devoted followers. Momonga only does things that will benefit Nazarick or himself, whether it's information or prestige. Although he does have a sense of justice and doesn't hate humans as much as his followers, he holds no attachment to them, and he feels nothing toward their deaths.

On the way home from the convenience store, he suddenly finds himself transported into another world. He has the ability that he calls ""Return by Death"" to go back in time when he dies, with only himself being aware of the reversal of time. Despite being a hikikomori and gamer in his real world, Subaru does a bit of workout and seems to know basic hand-to-hand combat, making him not completely weak.

While Subaru tends to not read the situation, he is loyal to those he holds dear, willing to help them, even if that means taking the thorny path. He has his resolve confirmed through the many situations and circumstances he faces in the fantasy world, originally having been one to always take the ""easy"" route. As a hikikomori, he is hopeful of the possibilities that being sucked into a new realm brings, but later realizes the realities of the predicament he is in. Ultimately, he resolves himself to be faithful and protective of the ones that he cares most about.

Raphtalia is a Tanuki-type Demi-Human who was the first real member of the Shield Hero's party after he purchased her as a slave.

She has undergone some significant changes throughout the story. When Raphtalia is first introduced, she is a child that has long, unmanaged hair and a dirty cloth gown. After being purchased by Naofumi, he gave her a haircut to an acceptable length, gave her a bath, and bought her a much more suitable set of clothes to adventure in.

After several weeks of traveling with Naofumi, Raphtalia's body inexplicably changes and she gained the appearance of a teenager or young adult. It is revealed that demi-humans grow in relation to the progression of their levels, which led to Raphtalia's rapid development.

He is the son of the late Gaius Amidonia and older brother of Roroa Amidonia.


Julius was a vain, egotistical individual, and had dreams of grandeur and conquest. Though not as hot-headed as his father, he did share the same ideals. However, his ability to govern a country was severely lacking as he did not understand the needs of the Amidonian citizens, nor was he able to solve domestic issues, since, like his father, he followed a 'military first' outlook.

His personality becomes a bit more subdued after the disastrous invasion of Elfrieden and the annexation of his country. He initially held a large grudge against Kazuya for his defeat and for taking away his country and birthright.

She eventually marries ""Albert"" giving him her family name with it and the role of 13th King of Elfrieden.

In her youth, Elisha was tomboyish for a princess, often taking risks and acting unlike a princess. At the time, she was certain that given her station she was never a actual contender for the throne of Elfrieden. After the first instance of her magic sending memories back to her, she became much more reserved and pragmatic, acting more like a princess despite her desires as she wished to remain alive more. During the events of the succession crisis, she routinely received memories from future-selves and would mentally spiral into a depressive state. It was not until she decided to chose Albert that she began to have hope for the value of her own life again. She was resistant to succeeding the throne, and would force it upon her husband. She remained a devoted supporter through Albert's reign and was a motivating factor behind Kazuya's ascension to the throne. While she is still generally reserved and quiet, she is a doting grandmother to Cian and Kazuha.

The main female protagonist. She is a silver-haired half-elf girl who is one of the candidates to become the next ruler in the royal election. Subaru first meets her when her insignia is stolen by Felt as she needs to possess it to be eligible to participate in the election. She introduces herself as Satella when she and Subaru met during the first timeline before introducing herself by her real name when she got her insignia back.

Emilia is good natured and likes to take care of others, though she herself refuses to admit it, instead thinking of it as her own selfishness. She is indifferent to her own appearance, leaving Puck to take care of her clothes and hair. Because her appearance is similar to the Witch of Envy, she has received unfair discrimination from others. She sometimes acts like a child and is unacquainted with the world as she used to live in the woods with other Elves, though despite this she still works hard to become a ruler.",Main,"Takahashi, Rie, Mills, Kayli, Leal, Lupita, Pietermann, Gabrielle, Mendes, Lina","Japanese, English, Spanish, German, Portuguese (BR)","https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/78665.jpg?s=f6d673ce224e9558e9eebac399f102f4, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/78266.jpg?s=dd2dbcf2917cfb9b4bc45c157ded49f4, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/25963.jpg?s=1fa9c097ae8f09f03bf8f4e124468e0b, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/42286.jpg?s=bf4861f1d8ff085c3739c38b9b23f239, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/63474.jpg?s=ee1772a71a8733e11b3e706f7fc40428"

On the way home from the convenience store, he suddenly finds himself transported into another world. He has the ability that he calls ""Return by Death"" to go back in time when he dies, with only himself being aware of the reversal of time. Despite being a hikikomori and gamer in his real world, Subaru does a bit of workout and seems to know basic hand-to-hand combat, making him not completely weak.

While Subaru tends to not read the situation, he is loyal to those he holds dear, willing to help them, even if that means taking the thorny path. He has his resolve confirmed through the many situations and circumstances he faces in the fantasy world, originally having been one to always take the ""easy"" route. As a hikikomori, he is hopeful of the possibilities that being sucked into a new realm brings, but later realizes the realities of the predicament he is in. Ultimately, he resolves himself to be faithful and protective of the ones that he cares most about.

However, he claims that he isn't drawn to them because they're young but rather because they have pure and genuine souls, and people who have such souls are typically young. Because of this, he was able to determine that Emilia was mentally young for her age and that Lewes' soul was much more mature than her appearance suggested. Although he has known Frederica for ten years starting from the time he began working as a manservant, he tends to be prejudiced toward her appearance, resulting in bad relations between the two of them.

Kurumi Tokisaki is the main antagonist in the series. She is the third Spirit to be encountered in the series and is the most dangerous and lethal Spirit. She is heavily obsessed with Shidou and has the ability to manipulate time. Her codename is Nightmare. She has a split personality: that of a gentle, mysterious high school girl with a slow talking pattern, and that of a psychopathic killer. Kurumi is very aggressive in her actions which makes it harder for Shidou to capture her. Kurumi can be described a person whose personality is hard to read, possessing a well-polished dislike of humanity that borders on mistrust, something she shared with many Spirits in their debut. She is a skilled actress, capable of putting on the façade of an innocent, curious young girl when she needs to, shown when she registered as a student at the Raizen High School, even speaking in a very polite manner; however, under that mask lies a psychotic woman, prone to fits of insane laughter that possesses no regard for human life, regarding them as a food source to restore her own time, and thus, a disposable commodity. There is a twisted justice behind her methods, however, as the people that she brutally murdered were would-be rapists and animal abusers. In hindsight, Kurumi possesses some degree of innocence that her psychotic behavior have not entirely ruined; she has a soft spot for small animals and other creatures. She once slaughtered four humans not because she needed to replenish her time, but because they were trying to kill a kitten, this is the closest to a humanizing emotion that she has. Mana reported that Kurumi is the most dangerous spirit known, who has personally killed over 10,000 people which does not include the spacequake's victims within that statistics. Kurumi used unstated and unexplained methods to personally transfer into Shidou Itsuka's high school and classroom so she can get closer to him. Her purposes and reasons in this transfer are simple; consume Shidou Itsuka, in doing so gain their memories, goals, fears and obsessions. In some non-canon stories, the clone Shidou seduced shows some ""independent"" attitude, almost rebellious, and openly acts lovey-dovey with Shidou, which causes troubles to the ""main"" Kurumi and even leads to confrontation with her.



Kurumi has the ability to manipulate the 4th dimension, mainly time, but her main power is associated with controlling shadows. Shadow is her primary power while Time is her secondary power in terms of usage. Combined with the power of time, she can create a clone with all her experiences, memories, abilities, etc. These clones however are shadows of her past selves who contain feelings the current Kurumi no longer possesses, Kurumi will kill these clones if they are swayed away from her goals. These clones are less powerful than Kurumi herself as she has mentioned in the last chapter of volume 3 and in the epilogue of volume 4. She can form a single clone by shooting herself with Zafkiel or bring out all of her clones at once from a pool of shadows which she also uses to draw them all back in and all the time they've collected. She can also call her clones partially through small fields of shadows, most often to hold someone in place and prevent them from moving. To activate any power she needs, she first needs to call her Angel (regardless of whether or not the Angel has been summoned already or not), and to position both of her guns just like a clock: The musket on 12 and the flintlock points at the number of the bullet. Next she needs to shoot the bullet at the target with the hand gun. In case she needs it for herself, she will be required to shoot it at her head. She also has the ability to call and dismiss spacequakes at will, as shown in the series while she confronts Shidou on the school's rooftop.

White Queen wears a white military dress decorated with epaulettes, and a white admiral's cap with an emblem similar to that of a rising sun on the front of it. In the middle of the emblem is a clock face. She also wears white gloves and white, heeled boots. She has long white hair usually tied in symmetrical twin tails. Her right eye is red-tinted while her left eye appears as a blue clock face. She is stated to look identical to Kurumi, aside from the obvious colour scheme differences.

Rather than a battle maniac, the White Queen is a strategist. She performed infiltration, acts of terrorism, and experiments to change Empty into monsters to strengthen her army. She also captured and tortured Cistus to study and exploit Zaphkiel's power. The White Queen is also callous, aggressive and intelligent. These traits combined together make for a formidable opponent, and this was acknowledged by the other Dominions. She has immense power, and all the tools at her disposal to back it up. She is considered and careful when planning attacks and engaging in battle, and will sacrifice her own soldiers when needed to ensure a victory. She also has the capacity to forward plan, and is uninhibited by taboos in the Neighboring World, one of these including encroaching on other Regions. The White Queen is goal-oriented and believes that her goal is far more important than the lives of her enemies and allies, as shown by how readily she sacrifices her own troops.

Ferdinand teaches and guides her to be a 'proper' shrine maiden and noble lady.

Ferdinand is a serious, disciplined and pragmatic person. He has a bit of a fussy personality, leading him to take on all sorts of responsibilities, including Myne's education. Ferdinand is meritocratic in spite of his social status, despising incompetence and laziness the most, and earning him the reputation of a harsh disciplinarian who would cut off anyone who couldn't meet his standard. The same trait leads him to favor Myne ever since their first interaction, calling her worthwhile to educate.

Originally a young woman from our world who just finished her studies to become a librarian and died buried in her own books after an earthquake caused her bookshelves to fall on her, she found herself reincarnated in a very frail body of a 5-year-old young girl called Myne in a fantasy world.

She loves books above everything else and living a quiet life surrounded by books is her long life goal.

She has read a massive amount of books in her former life and has a good memory of the content that especially interested her.

While originally her motivation was only books and she didn't care about anything else, she becomes more and more involved in many other things, as she start to care and love more and more her new family and many other peoples she encounters.

Her body is so frail that she easily get tired after walking for a bit, and whenever she forces herself too much she gets strong fevers that can last for days.

She has a strong talent to teach others and motivate them in their studies.

She is usually very level headed but will go berserk whenever books get involved. The peoples around her know that tendency and will try to reason her whenever she becomes too reckless. As time passes, she became more receptive to those words, especially when they come from Ferdinand and Lutz.",Main,"Iguchi, Yuka, Buhr, Reba, Ponzanelli, Valca","Japanese, English, Spanish","https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/74740.jpg?s=d21e520338730b649b677112ddc11291, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/47394.jpg?s=06a67f547ee536e8e1ade8f8ac0650fd, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/73328.jpg?s=efc4a5f41830a7a5dbc39d8b34d8165f"

Offended by the affront, Sei does not reveal that she is actually the Saint (she confirms this in the LN when reading her own status board). During her early months working at the Medicinal Flora Research Institute, her sainthood is nearly found out multiple times due to some accidental scenes with her research. Sei is only publicly acknowledged as the Saint after many people have seen and attested to her abilities. She likes to cook and make cosmetics in her spare time. She owns a cosmetic business in the capital.

Roxanne is described as stunningly beautiful with enchanting reddish brown eyes, magnificent lips, thick chestnut brown hair, and big breasts. Her height is similar to Michio's, a little over 160 cm. She has soft floppy dog ears on her head.

Roxanne was introduced during Michio's first visit to Vale by Alan the slave merchant. Alan had offered her to Michio, but seeing that Michio couldn't afford her at the time, Alan offered to hold her for 10 days while Michio gathered money. On the 10th day after Alan's offer, Michio returned and purchased Roxanne. Together, they left and headed for the Pavilion Inn. After a minor misunderstanding, Michio told Roxanne that he came form a distant land and admitted that he lacked common sense of the area. He requested that she assist in teaching him common sense as well as how to read and write in the Brahim language to which she hesitantly agreed.

In combat, she carefully watches the enemy so she that she can understand how it's going to move, so that she would only need to move her body a little. The secret of Roxanne's insane ability came from playing with monsters ever since she was a kid, however, she could play like that only because she could dodge.

He was always bullied and was disliked by both of his male and female classmates for being close to their idol-like classmate Kaori. After wishing for his annoying classmates to be summoned to another world, the next thing he saw was they were on top of a pillar like structure in another world to become heroes.

He obtained the job of ""Synergist"" and continued to be bullied due to also being weak in this new world. He eventually fell into an abyss due to being hit by a classmate's fireball where he survived though a hell-like environment to become the powerful man he is today.

Hajime at the beginning of the story is said to have black hair and also has a slim body. He also had a kind face and attitude. But after falling in the abyss and eating a wolf-like monster, his body began to violently degenerate. When he drunk the sacred water, it made his body heal by destroying his bones and muscles then healing over and over again until he got a very muscular body due to overcompensation.

Due to the stress of breaking and healing, his hair turned white, a victim of the Marie Antoinette syndrome. His eyes also turned red and his body gained tattoo-like red lines which is the sign of him becoming a demonic monster similar to the monsters he ate that also possessed red lines along their bodies.

His personality was at first kind though he was considered incompetent. But after falling in the abyss, he became cruel and would kill any person who wants to cause him misfortune. He would also smile in front of danger which made Shia call him a new species of monster called ""Predator."" He may be cruel but he cares for his comrades.

She cares strongly for , and demonstrates this by constantly trying to protect her. During the process of being summoned into Menou's world, Akari is assigned the Pure Concept of Time (which is initially improperly attached to her soul). 

Although usually unaware of it, she is virtually unkillable due to her ability. Akari has strongly hinted that prior to being summoned, she has had a rather lonely life in Japan which has caused her to embrace being in Menou's world.

When Akari has her memories of past regressions, she is a very capable user of her Pure Concept. She is not well trained as a fighter though, and in combat is forced to rely on her power completely.

She decides to go on a journey with Menou because she believes meeting her was fate. However, Menou is trying to find a way to kill her. Usually Akari is unaware of this, but in emergencies she gains back her memories from previous regressions. Her goal is to be killed by Menou while keeping her alive. After the emergency has been resolved, Akari uses Regression: Memories, Soul and Spirit on herself to erase her knowledge of the past time loops.

Her parents were murdered and sensing her life was in danger she fled to Milteu were she gets together a small group of abandoned orphans together and starts to give tours to people so that her and her friends can get by earnestly. Which works until a local noble places a bounty on their heads to be then sold into slavery and prostitution. She and her friends are saved by Lugh when he is sent to Milteu for undercover work to train as a merchant under an alias his father had created for him Illig Balor. Illig Balor bought her out of slavery and had her adopted by his merchant family the Balor's to seaver as his right-hand man and run both his cosmetic empire and his information network. 

She spends a couple of years being trained as one of Lugh's assassin assistants and is extremely important to Lugh. Overtime she falls in love with Lugh saying ""At first we admired you as our great older brother. But as we got older how could we not fall in love with the best guy around."" Lugh not wanting to take advantage of her at first turns her down. 
Maha is smart and clever but with Lugh's assassin training she becomes strong and agile as well as an excellent acting director of Lugh's growing cosmetics and chocolate empire. She exposes this rule Lugh quietly set for himself about not taking advantage of her and Tarte and remind him that it is encouraged and normal that nobles take on a couple mistresses.

She cares deeply for Lugh because he saved her life. Tarte's family often call Tarte useless and worthless giving her a complex about this labeling, when things got tough her family abandoned her because they could not feed everyone in the family. 
Nearly starved to death and alone she wonders into the forest where she has a dream in which God tells her to travel to Tuatha Dé territory were she will have a fateful encounter. Lugh then saved her from being eaten by a pack of wolves moments before they got to her.
After saving her life and Lugh telling her he needs her, she spends the next two years training her to be an assassin worthy of Lugh. 

After saving her life Tarte slowly starts to fall in love with Lugh and with Dia and Lugh's mothers encouragement becomes one of his mistresses. Which at first Lugh was not on board with the idea because he felt like he was taking advantage of her.

As a baby, his parents found him and raised him to later regret their decision due to his destructive powers scaring them and all the other villagers.

He finds it difficult to restrain his power due to it being emitted when he is under emotional distress. This causes him to apologize to his lover Gozu constantly even over minute issues to the point Gozu has to yell at him to stop apologizing. 

He is unmoved by what others say about him, yet he is quite sensitive to comments made by specific people or if they're ill-natured towards Gozu. He is a Rational thinker though, of which always puts his beliefs and morals ahead of his own gain. Rather than being a destructive demon king, he acts consciously to help others in need.

He has short cream coloured hair with striking red eyes. He is short in stature and very slim which gets him mistaken as a woman by Mackiddie. He wears a red black and cream Robe alongside a frilly white undershirt, grey shorts and black boots.

Since he is not very tall and very lanky he looks like a child, he has long black hair and dark blue eyes. What is striking about Hoshi is his star-shaped birthmark on his left cheek and his permanent grin. Like the other male students, he most often wears a white shirt with a blue tie. 


Hoshi is inscrutable, very calm and incredibly mature. He is held in high esteem by the others, and people are happy to turn to him for help or advice. Hoshi makes a friendly impression and interacts a lot with other students, but this is deceptive because he is very manipulative, he has no regard for others and seems to have other goals. He is incredibly firm and sees himself as superior to others, so he likes to shoo others around him. 

Hoshi has an ability called Hope , which allows him to show visions to others that he has created himself. To make use of his abilities, he folds his hands as if he were praying. The visions he plants in others are usually horrific and include content such as death and destruction, he uses these to get others to cooperate with him.

Momonga only does things that will benefit Nazarick or himself, whether it's information or prestige. Although he does have a sense of justice and doesn't hate humans as much as his followers, he holds no attachment to them, and he feels nothing toward their deaths.

She is described as a young woman that has long blonde hair with green eyes and pink lips that showed a healthy gleam. Her beauty falls short of Renner but overflows with a different charm.

Lakyus is a very bright person who enjoys adventuring with her friends. She sometimes acts weird like wearing apparently meaningless rings or fighting against her dark personality, making her other team members worry about her actually becoming evil. When Lakyus was a young girl, she decided to become an adventurer after hearing the adventure stories about Red Drop. She ran away from home to have an adventure, while she was still inexperienced, she was saved by Gagaran and the two became partners.

Lakyus becomes one of the strongest adventurers of the kingdom at the age of 19 for her near Heroic-level abilities. She is also one of the few users of revival magic.

She is in charge of the general management and supervises the activities of the seven Floor Guardians, meaning that she ranks above all the other NPCs in Nazarick. She is the sister of Nigredo and Spinel. She was created by Tabula Smaragdina.

An impeccable beauty, Albedo is a woman with lustrous jet-black hair and the face of a goddess. She has golden irises and vertically split pupils; on her left and right temples are two thick horns protruding crookedly, and on her waist is a pair of black angel wings.

Albedo wears a pure white dress with silky gloves covering her slender hands, and a golden spiderweb necklace that covers her shoulders and chest. In combat, she wears an impressive black full plate armor with a unique helm and carries a battle-axe with her.

Like Shalltear, Albedo has a true form as a heteromorphic race NPC. Shalltear called her a ""big mouthed gorilla"" when they quarreled, so her true form may be quite large in size.

Extremely loyal and extremely in love, Albedo is completely infatuated with Momonga, often showing obsessive tendencies when it comes to his affairs. She is always vying for Momonga's affection, showcasing outbursts of jealousy whenever anyone else appears to be getting close to him. This is because the last thing Momonga did in Yggdrasil was to use his administrative privileges to edit her character history, adding the she is ""madly in love"" with him.

Among all the Guardians, Albedo is the most vocal when it comes to expressing opinions. She will openly denounce any statement or action deemed inappropriate, reaching the point where Momonga sometimes considers it an annoyance.

As the Overseer of the Floor Guardians, she is very levelheaded. Albedo can make calm and collected judgments that Ainz, sometimes, doesn't think of. She takes Ainz's orders as top priority and absolute, punishing anyone, even a Floor Guardian, who'd dare belittle his orders. Like many others in Nazarick, she absolutely loathes humans and views them as an inferior species.

In the web novel version, Albedo does not exist.

Occupation: 1st~3rd Floor Guardian
Karma: Negative 450 (Very~Extremely Evil)
Creator: Peroroncino

Shalltear is a true vampire and the Floor Guardian of the first to third floors in the Great Tomb of Nazarick. She was created by Peroroncino.

Shalltear has a very flirtatious personality and is very open with her sexual preferences, often to other characters' discomfort. Despite her apparent shamelessness, she can be quite innocent about certain things. She has a complex about her small figure, which she attempts to cover up by using breast pads.

As a true vampire, Shalltear is extremely proud and takes her position as a Floor Guardian very seriously. She has no patience for failure and will often burst into fits of rage at signs of an unfavorable situation. She will not hesitate to kill any servant who disappoints her; however, she will not punish others for failing in tasks that are impossible to begin with.

Shalltear is completely loyal to Momonga and is also a love rival to Albedo for his affections. She takes great joy in being able to prove her worth and fantasizes about the praise she expects to receive. When a situation doesn't go in her favor, she panics about the scolding she believes that she will get.

He wants to become stronger for her sake. He wears pure white, full plate armor given to him by Renner and is equipped with a broadsword and a shield.

Climb is described as a hard-working and hot-blooded person, and has pledged absolute allegiance to Renner. For her sake, he trains tireless everyday to improve his swordsmanship as to repay her kindness. Because of the preferential treatment he receives from the princess, he has no close relationship with anyone but her. However, he has proven himself to be quite loyal and determined to protect those he cares about. If need be, he would even sacrifice his life for her.

He lived in Re-Estize during his childhood and encountered misfortune through his life. His parents were gone for unknown reasons when he was very young, and he became a street urchin living on whatever scraps of food he could find, living in an empty house where he was comfortable. Half starved and close to death, he was later saved and taken in by Renner.

Unfortunately, despite his constant training to become stronger, Climb has no special talent for the sword at all. He possessed a ring created through wild magic that can push a person's abilities to their limits. He has self-evaluated himself to be equivalent to a gold rank adventurer, holding a respectable amount of strength.

She is in charge of the general management and supervises the activities of the seven Floor Guardians, meaning that she ranks above all the other NPCs in Nazarick. She is the sister of Nigredo and Spinel. She was created by Tabula Smaragdina.

An impeccable beauty, Albedo is a woman with lustrous jet-black hair and the face of a goddess. She has golden irises and vertically split pupils; on her left and right temples are two thick horns protruding crookedly, and on her waist is a pair of black angel wings.

Albedo wears a pure white dress with silky gloves covering her slender hands, and a golden spiderweb necklace that covers her shoulders and chest. In combat, she wears an impressive black full plate armor with a unique helm and carries a battle-axe with her.

Like Shalltear, Albedo has a true form as a heteromorphic race NPC. Shalltear called her a ""big mouthed gorilla"" when they quarreled, so her true form may be quite large in size.

Extremely loyal and extremely in love, Albedo is completely infatuated with Momonga, often showing obsessive tendencies when it comes to his affairs. She is always vying for Momonga's affection, showcasing outbursts of jealousy whenever anyone else appears to be getting close to him. This is because the last thing Momonga did in Yggdrasil was to use his administrative privileges to edit her character history, adding the she is ""madly in love"" with him.

Among all the Guardians, Albedo is the most vocal when it comes to expressing opinions. She will openly denounce any statement or action deemed inappropriate, reaching the point where Momonga sometimes considers it an annoyance.

As the Overseer of the Floor Guardians, she is very levelheaded. Albedo can make calm and collected judgments that Ainz, sometimes, doesn't think of. She takes Ainz's orders as top priority and absolute, punishing anyone, even a Floor Guardian, who'd dare belittle his orders. Like many others in Nazarick, she absolutely loathes humans and views them as an inferior species.

As shown in her karma value, Yuri is good-hearted and one of the two ""safe"" Pleiades to humans. Thus, she felt relief when Ainz said not to kill humans without proper reason. When given permission to do as she pleases, she chooses to help people in destitution. She uses ""boku"" as a first-person pronoun when speaking in private, revealing a somewhat childish nature.

Race: Heteromorphic Race, Undead, True Vampire
Occupation: 1st~3rd Floor Guardian
Karma: Negative 450 (Very~Extremely Evil)
Creator: Peroroncino

Shalltear is a true vampire and the Floor Guardian of the first to third floors in the Great Tomb of Nazarick. She was created by Peroroncino.

Shalltear has a very flirtatious personality and is very open with her sexual preferences, often to other characters' discomfort. Despite her apparent shamelessness, she can be quite innocent about certain things. She has a complex about her small figure, which she attempts to cover up by using breast pads.

As a true vampire, Shalltear is extremely proud and takes her position as a Floor Guardian very seriously. She has no patience for failure and will often burst into fits of rage at signs of an unfavorable situation. She will not hesitate to kill any servant who disappoints her; however, she will not punish others for failing in tasks that are impossible to begin with.

Shalltear is completely loyal to Momonga and is also a love rival to Albedo for his affections. She takes great joy in being able to prove her worth and fantasizes about the praise she expects to receive. When a situation doesn't go in her favor, she panics about the scolding she believes that she will get.

With a tail twice as long as his height, Cocytus is covered with sharp spikes like icicles and has a strong jaw that can easily snap people's hands. Two of his hands hold a silver halberd, while the remaining two hands hold a mace emitting black light and a crooked shape sheath which seems to be for a broadsword. With a breathtaking cold air, the pale blue, hardened bone armor oozes out diamond dust like bright light. His shoulders and back look like an uplifted iceberg.

The goddess of water who judged humans to send to the RPG world, up until Kazuma dragged her along with him. She is an energetic and simpleminded girl who likes to receive reverence for her status and gets upset easily. As an Archpriest and a goddess, she is powerful against demons and the undead, and is able to resurrect recently deceased people as well as purify water supplies. Rather than learning skills which would benefit her party, she spends most of her skill points learning Party Tricks.

He was then sent to Demon Children's Garden, an elementary correctional institution that raises and exerts full control over young demons. There, he experiences a strict and harsh environment as he was told he was dirtying his family name and was bullied for it. Amidst the negativity in the garden, he met and befriended a girl around his age at that time who was similar to him in terms of grades. She let him touch her charm, her grandmother's earring, which she said would make him feel more cheerful. However, the bullies took it and threw it off the cliff. Kirio managed to catch it with his barrier, but it broke as he lost focus and the earring fell while the girl watched in despair. After the incident, the girl quit the Garden while Kirio was forced to remain by his parents.

The main protagonist of the series and Founder as well as Chancellor and King of the monster nation known as the Jura-Tempest Federation. Originally Mikami Satoru, a 37-year-old general contractor, he was stabbed by a passing robber while protecting one of his co-workers and reincarnated in a new world as a slime, one of the lowest monsters on the food chain.

In spite of the situations he finds himself in, he often tends to be very easygoing, yet calculating and cautious. A pacifist at heart, he tries to avoid casualties and save people if possible and wishes to maintain good relations with humans.

After building up some power, it grew bored and decided to depart the ruins to explore new lands, but got stuck on a mana-depleting zone and lost its freedom for several weeks. Eventually, a black cat beastkin slave found it by chance while fleeing from a monster and the sword helped her regain her freedom. As a result both decided to continue together and the sword bestowed the girl with a name (Fran) and a contract which shares its abilities with her. Fran in return named the sword Shishou (Master).

Shishou eventually also summons a familiar and names it Urushi, which ends up as Fran's familiar as well.

He also gains the ability to create doppelgangers of himself, which look like his former human self.

He is the son of the late Gaius Amidonia and older brother of Roroa Amidonia.


Julius was a vain, egotistical individual, and had dreams of grandeur and conquest. Though not as hot-headed as his father, he did share the same ideals. However, his ability to govern a country was severely lacking as he did not understand the needs of the Amidonian citizens, nor was he able to solve domestic issues, since, like his father, he followed a 'military first' outlook.

His personality becomes a bit more subdued after the disastrous invasion of Elfrieden and the annexation of his country. He initially held a large grudge against Kazuya for his defeat and for taking away his country and birthright.

She eventually marries ""Albert"" giving him her family name with it and the role of 13th King of Elfrieden.

In her youth, Elisha was tomboyish for a princess, often taking risks and acting unlike a princess. At the time, she was certain that given her station she was never a actual contender for the throne of Elfrieden. After the first instance of her magic sending memories back to her, she became much more reserved and pragmatic, acting more like a princess despite her desires as she wished to remain alive more. During the events of the succession crisis, she routinely received memories from future-selves and would mentally spiral into a depressive state. It was not until she decided to chose Albert that she began to have hope for the value of her own life again. She was resistant to succeeding the throne, and would force it upon her husband. She remained a devoted supporter through Albert's reign and was a motivating factor behind Kazuya's ascension to the throne. While she is still generally reserved and quiet, she is a doting grandmother to Cian and Kazuha.

She was the protagonist of the original otome game. She is also the Saint of the Holfort Kingdom in the otome game. 

She is by all means a modest girl who is very kind and gentle with people. She dislikes gambling. As a commoner, she's often shocked if not stressed on how most things around her are so expensive &amp; luxurious.

Despite her kindness and modesty, she lacks a consistent amount of self-confidence, which most likely stems from how she is a commoner who attends a school that is dominantly populated by nobles who mostly look down on her.

He was always bullied and was disliked by both of his male and female classmates for being close to their idol-like classmate Kaori. After wishing for his annoying classmates to be summoned to another world, the next thing he saw was they were on top of a pillar like structure in another world to become heroes.

He obtained the job of ""Synergist"" and continued to be bullied due to also being weak in this new world. He eventually fell into an abyss due to being hit by a classmate's fireball where he survived though a hell-like environment to become the powerful man he is today.

Hajime at the beginning of the story is said to have black hair and also has a slim body. He also had a kind face and attitude. But after falling in the abyss and eating a wolf-like monster, his body began to violently degenerate. When he drunk the sacred water, it made his body heal by destroying his bones and muscles then healing over and over again until he got a very muscular body due to overcompensation.

Due to the stress of breaking and healing, his hair turned white, a victim of the Marie Antoinette syndrome. His eyes also turned red and his body gained tattoo-like red lines which is the sign of him becoming a demonic monster similar to the monsters he ate that also possessed red lines along their bodies.

His personality was at first kind though he was considered incompetent. But after falling in the abyss, he became cruel and would kill any person who wants to cause him misfortune. He would also smile in front of danger which made Shia call him a new species of monster called ""Predator."" He may be cruel but he cares for his comrades.

Her saintly powers include a fifty percent boost in the efficacy of anything she makes using her power. Sei was not immediately recognized as the Saint at the conclusion of the summoning ritual due to her appearance. Offended by the affront, Sei does not reveal that she is actually the Saint (she confirms this in the LN when reading her own status board). During her early months working at the Medicinal Flora Research Institute, her sainthood is nearly found out multiple times due to some accidental scenes with her research. Sei is only publicly acknowledged as the Saint after many people have seen and attested to her abilities. She likes to cook and make cosmetics in her spare time. She owns a cosmetic business in the capital.

He was always bullied and was disliked by both of his male and female classmates for being close to their idol-like classmate Kaori. After wishing for his annoying classmates to be summoned to another world, the next thing he saw was they were on top of a pillar like structure in another world to become heroes.

He obtained the job of ""Synergist"" and continued to be bullied due to also being weak in this new world. He eventually fell into an abyss due to being hit by a classmate's fireball where he survived though a hell-like environment to become the powerful man he is today.

Hajime at the beginning of the story is said to have black hair and also has a slim body. He also had a kind face and attitude. But after falling in the abyss and eating a wolf-like monster, his body began to violently degenerate. When he drunk the sacred water, it made his body heal by destroying his bones and muscles then healing over and over again until he got a very muscular body due to overcompensation.

Due to the stress of breaking and healing, his hair turned white, a victim of the Marie Antoinette syndrome. His eyes also turned red and his body gained tattoo-like red lines which is the sign of him becoming a demonic monster similar to the monsters he ate that also possessed red lines along their bodies.

His personality was at first kind though he was considered incompetent. But after falling in the abyss, he became cruel and would kill any person who wants to cause him misfortune. He would also smile in front of danger which made Shia call him a new species of monster called ""Predator."" He may be cruel but he cares for his comrades.

Originally a young woman from our world who just finished her studies to become a librarian and died buried in her own books after an earthquake caused her bookshelves to fall on her, she found herself reincarnated in a very frail body of a 5-year-old young girl called Myne in a fantasy world.

She loves books above everything else and living a quiet life surrounded by books is her long life goal.

She has read a massive amount of books in her former life and has a good memory of the content that especially interested her.

While originally her motivation was only books and she didn't care about anything else, she becomes more and more involved in many other things, as she start to care and love more and more her new family and many other peoples she encounters.

Her body is so frail that she easily get tired after walking for a bit, and whenever she forces herself too much she gets strong fevers that can last for days.

A rather reasonable and calm young man who decided to realize his dream of a quiet, comfortable life and a harem of several slaves in the new world. Despite the fact that he was often bullied in the old world, he did not get angry, but this causes him to sometimes manifest difficulties in communication and emotional tightness, as well as a thirst for human intimacy, love and friendship. Treats his slaves as family members, or rather wives, and expects the same attitude and trust in return.

Roxanne is described as stunningly beautiful with enchanting reddish brown eyes, magnificent lips, thick chestnut brown hair, and big breasts. Her height is similar to Michio's, a little over 160 cm. She has soft floppy dog ears on her head.

Roxanne was introduced during Michio's first visit to Vale by Alan the slave merchant. Alan had offered her to Michio, but seeing that Michio couldn't afford her at the time, Alan offered to hold her for 10 days while Michio gathered money. On the 10th day after Alan's offer, Michio returned and purchased Roxanne. Together, they left and headed for the Pavilion Inn. After a minor misunderstanding, Michio told Roxanne that he came form a distant land and admitted that he lacked common sense of the area. He requested that she assist in teaching him common sense as well as how to read and write in the Brahim language to which she hesitantly agreed.

In combat, she carefully watches the enemy so she that she can understand how it's going to move, so that she would only need to move her body a little. The secret of Roxanne's insane ability came from playing with monsters ever since she was a kid, however, she could play like that only because she could dodge.

Eunha Park wakes up one day in a place she doesn't recognize. Suddenly she realizes that she has been reincarnated into the world of a novel. Namely as the supporting character Raeliana McMillain who is killed by her fiancé. Now Eunha aka Raeliana is trying to change her destiny. Her only option is to ask the high-ranking noble Noah Wynknight for an engagement contract. So her ex-fiancé wouldn't do anything if she has the most powerful duke as her fiancé...would he?

Raeliana is a very open and extroverted person. She is shown to be sarcastic and dramatic at times. Also, she isn't shy and says everything she thinks about without holding anything in. Raeliana is brave and barely fears anything nor does she let people look down on her. She is really soft to her loved ones, especially Rosemary, her little sister. In difficult times, she keeps a cool head and tries to find solutions without panicking. The only one who can actually make her flustered is her contract fiancé Noah Wynknight.",Main,"Miyamoto, Yume, Bescht, Valérie, Estrada, Effy, Seidel, Lindsay, Martins, Loretta, Friede, Franciska","Japanese, French, Spanish, English, Portuguese (BR), German","https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/74454.jpg?s=52b844014596ab1a7d1076c72c7aa39a, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/71724.jpg?s=e9e8e2d2563d99fd55ab71415d13daa8, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/65463.jpg?s=a4cbffd771ee3736a91c3f40ee7848f0, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/12459.jpg?s=1376b36c0b195dcbc7986717bd0f0ed6, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/75014.jpg?s=9c4f0a99cf99ad2c22f90a5cf0e2537a, https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/46548.jpg?s=73216bc7e60f59de08ce5ba06e545b6a"

Sasaki is very mature and polite. He always tries to resolve things in calm reasonable way. Due to his maturity and hard work he is easily depended on by everyone.

Sasaki is also very compassionate, as he always comforts Otonari and he tried to offer help to Magical Pink, thinking she might be lost child. This also applies in his work, as he makes sure that all his workers are properly rewarded like French.

He is a huge animal lover. He loves watching animal videos in free time.

He was always bullied and was disliked by both of his male and female classmates for being close to their idol-like classmate Kaori. After wishing for his annoying classmates to be summoned to another world, the next thing he saw was they were on top of a pillar like structure in another world to become heroes.

He obtained the job of ""Synergist"" and continued to be bullied due to also being weak in this new world. He eventually fell into an abyss due to being hit by a classmate's fireball where he survived though a hell-like environment to become the powerful man he is today.

Hajime at the beginning of the story is said to have black hair and also has a slim body. He also had a kind face and attitude. But after falling in the abyss and eating a wolf-like monster, his body began to violently degenerate. When he drunk the sacred water, it made his body heal by destroying his bones and muscles then healing over and over again until he got a very muscular body due to overcompensation.

Due to the stress of breaking and healing, his hair turned white, a victim of the Marie Antoinette syndrome. His eyes also turned red and his body gained tattoo-like red lines which is the sign of him becoming a demonic monster similar to the monsters he ate that also possessed red lines along their bodies.

His personality was at first kind though he was considered incompetent. But after falling in the abyss, he became cruel and would kill any person who wants to cause him misfortune. He would also smile in front of danger which made Shia call him a new species of monster called ""Predator."" He may be cruel but he cares for his comrades.

After ""awakening,"" the sword quickly learned to both move and fight on its own by using magic, and that it had the ability to absorb a monster's core to raise its strength.

After building up some power, it grew bored and decided to depart the ruins to explore new lands, but got stuck on a mana-depleting zone and lost its freedom for several weeks. Eventually, a black cat beastkin slave found it by chance while fleeing from a monster and the sword helped her regain her freedom. As a result both decided to continue together and the sword bestowed the girl with a name (Fran) and a contract which shares its abilities with her. Fran in return named the sword Shishou (Master).

Shishou eventually also summons a familiar and names it Urushi, which ends up as Fran's familiar as well.

He also gains the ability to create doppelgangers of himself, which look like his former human self.

She is by all means a modest girl who is very kind and gentle with people. She dislikes gambling. As a commoner, she's often shocked if not stressed on how most things around her are so expensive &amp; luxurious.

Despite her kindness and modesty, she lacks a consistent amount of self-confidence, which most likely stems from how she is a commoner who attends a school that is dominantly populated by nobles who mostly look down on her.

On the way home from the convenience store, he suddenly finds himself transported into another world. He has the ability that he calls ""Return by Death"" to go back in time when he dies, with only himself being aware of the reversal of time. Despite being a hikikomori and gamer in his real world, Subaru does a bit of workout and seems to know basic hand-to-hand combat, making him not completely weak.

While Subaru tends to not read the situation, he is loyal to those he holds dear, willing to help them, even if that means taking the thorny path. He has his resolve confirmed through the many situations and circumstances he faces in the fantasy world, originally having been one to always take the ""easy"" route. As a hikikomori, he is hopeful of the possibilities that being sucked into a new realm brings, but later realizes the realities of the predicament he is in. Ultimately, he resolves himself to be faithful and protective of the ones that he cares most about.

Filo was originally hatched from a monster egg which Naofumi purchased from the slave trader.

Filo grew at an abnormally fast rate and in just a few days grown into a fully grown Filolial later developing into a rare species of Filolial Queen where she was later given the ability to transform into a humanoid form strongly resembling a Angel and the ability to talk due to her association with the Shield Hero and the effects of the Legendary Shield.

Naofumi Iwatani is the main protagonist of The Rising of the Shield Hero.

He was a university student before being summoned to another world, where he had to fight against the waves of calamity, as one of the 4 cardinal heroes summoned. He was, however, the shield hero, regarded by many and especially people in Melromarc as the weakest of the heroes.

Due to his status as shield hero, many refused to join his side, the only exception being Myne Sophia. Myne however falsely accuses him of sexual assault causing him to lose his dignity and all his money
Due to this, the once cheerful Naofumi became a cynical character who lost the ability to trust in people.

He buys the slave Raphtalia and the bird Filo, but treats them like his daughters rather than his slaves.

Raphtalia is a Tanuki-type Demi-Human who was the first real member of the Shield Hero's party after he purchased her as a slave.

She has undergone some significant changes throughout the story. When Raphtalia is first introduced, she is a child that has long, unmanaged hair and a dirty cloth gown. After being purchased by Naofumi, he gave her a haircut to an acceptable length, gave her a bath, and bought her a much more suitable set of clothes to adventure in.

After several weeks of traveling with Naofumi, Raphtalia's body inexplicably changes and she gained the appearance of a teenager or young adult. It is revealed that demi-humans grow in relation to the progression of their levels, which led to Raphtalia's rapid development.
